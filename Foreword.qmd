# Foreword {.unnumbered}

Many technical terms are used throughout this report in the keys and definitions. These technical terms, printed here in italics, are defined in this book in the section ["Diagnostic Horizons and other Differentiae"](#diagnostics).

Other technical terms are defined in other books:

-   *Horizon notations* are defined by @clayden_horizon_1989.
-   *Soil morphology* terms are defined by @milne_soil_1991.
-   *Classes of the US Soil Taxonomy* are defined by @soil_survey_staff_soil_1999.
-   *Soil colours* are defined by @munsell_color_company_munsell_1975.
-   *Soil mineralogy classes* are defined by @whitton_new_1989 or @childs_proposed_1990. Note that the soil mineralogy class names given here are based on the following control section: 25 cm to 100 cm or to a lithic or paralithic contact if shallower.
-   *Soil chemical terms* are explained and the analytical methods are described by @blakemore_methods_1987. Note that soil pH measurements are made in water with a ratio of 1 part of soil to 2.5 parts of water, by weight.
-   *Soil physical terms* are explained and the analytical methods are described by @gradwell_c_1979.
-   Many other soil science concepts and technical terms are explained, in a New Zealand context, by @mclaren_soil_1990.

The following abbreviations are used for soil chemical terms.

CEC -- Cation exchange capacity.

ECEC -- Effective cation exchange capacity, which is the CEC at natural field pH, estimated by the sum of basic cations + KCl-extractable aluminium.

P retention -- Phosphate retention.
