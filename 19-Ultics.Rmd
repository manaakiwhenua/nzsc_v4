# Ultic Soils {-#ord-U}

## Concept of the Order {-#con-U}

Ultic soils are acid soils with clayey and/or organic illuvial features in subsoil horizons. They are developed in clayey weathering products of siliceous sediments or acid igneous rocks and usually contain mixtures of clay minerals including kaolinite, halloysite, aluminium-interlayered vermiculite and smectite. A few are developed in the weathering products of limestones and greensands. They have low potassium, magnesium and phosphorus reserves and small concentrations of weatherable minerals. E horizons or other features such as skeletans in the upper parts of the Bt horizon are indicative of clay destruction/removal processes. [Argillic horizons](#diag-argh) are usually present.

## Correlation {-#cor-U}

The order comprises most northern yellow-brown earths, podzolised northern yellow-brown earths, many central yellow-brown earths (particularly those described as derived from pre-weathered parent materials) and some northern podzols and yellow-brown sands of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. Most Ultic Soils are Ultisols in Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {-#occ-U}

Ultic Soils are most common in the northern North Island, and the Wellington, Marlborough and Nelson regions.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {-#acc-U}

1.  _Acidity._ KCl-extractable aluminium levels of more than 1\ cmol(+)/kg are usual in B horizons, and indicate toxic aluminium which may inhibit root function and may contribute to shallow rooting habits in aluminium-sensitive plants.
2.  _Clayey subsoils._ CEC values are medium to high. Ultic Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes, Kandic and Smectitic being the most common.
3.  _Low Kc and Mgr._ Low concentrations of reserve magnesium and potassium resulting from strong weathering.
4.  _Strongly weathered with low nutrient reserves._ Low levels of 0.5M\ H~2~SO~4~^-^ extractable phosphorus (usually less than 3\ mg/100\ g) and total phosphorus (usually less than 20\ mg/100\ g) are characteristic. The former reflects low solubility and/or a low level of inorganic phosphorus reserves. Phosphorus supply from inorganic sources under zero phosphorus input grassland farming is negligible after about 2 years. Strong weathering is indicated by low ratio of 0.5M\ H~2~SO~4~^-^-extractable phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus, usually 0.25 or less.
5.  _Slow permeability._ A slowly permeable layer occurs in clayey profiles. The majority of soils are imperfectly to poorly drained, few are well-drained. Soil water movement is mainly along planar voids.
6.  _Susceptibility to livestock treading damage._ Clayey or low strength silty surface horizons are susceptible to treading damage or compaction during wet periods.
7.  _Dispersible surface horizons._ Surface horizons, especially silty ones, are dispersible according to the test of McQueen (1981), and are prone to erosion where the surface cover has been removed. Although P retention is usually moderate or high in B horizons, it may be low in A and E horizons consistent with low contents of secondary iron oxides.
