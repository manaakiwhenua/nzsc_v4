# Granular Soils {-#ord-N}

## Concept of the Order {-#con-N}

Granular soils are clayey soils in which kaolin-group minerals are dominant, and are usually associated with vermiculite and hydrous-interlayered vermiculite. The soil fabric comprises polyhedral peds with strength characteristics which change rapidly with water content. Consistence is sticky and plastic. The presence of vermiculite gives these soils a moderate buffering capacity. The soils lack the weak strength, friable failure, low plasticity, and low-activity-clay properties which either define or are accessory to Oxidic Soils. Clay coatings where they occur are thin.

## Correlation {-#cor-N}

The order comprises many soils previously classified as brown granular loams and moderately to strongly leached brown granular clays of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. Most are correlated with the Ultisols but a few with the Alfisols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {-#occ-N}

Granular Soils are only known to occur in the northern North Island, particularly in the lowlands of the Waikato and South Auckland regions.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {-#acc-N}

1.  _Moderate activity clay._ CEC is greater than 16\ cmol/kg (clay) and ECEC ranges from about 8 to 16\ cmol/kg (clay).
2.  _Parent materials._ The soils are derived predominantly from strongly weathered tephras mostly older than 50\ 000 years, but also from basaltic and andesitic rocks with possible additions from aeolian material.
3.  _Kandic mineralogy._ Granular Soils usually belong to the Kandic mineralogy class.
4. _Slowly permeable._ Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow or marginally slow somewhere in the profile, resulting in periods of perching of water.
5.  _Limited root depth._ The extension of plant roots in subsoils is commonly limited by either high penetration resistance, wetness or aluminium toxicity.
6.  _Limited workability when wet._ Workability and trafficability is constrained by stickiness and plasticity after heavy rainfall, particularly in contrast to [Oxidic Soils](#X).
7.  _Low phosphorus status._ Phosphorus fixation may be high, as indicated by high P retention levels.
8.  _Strongly weathered with low nutrient reserves._ Reserves of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are low, particularly in the [Oxidic group](#NX).
9.  _Sulphate in B horizons._ Sulphate tends to be strongly adsorbed in B horizons.

Perch-gley Granular Soils occur in sites that are periodically saturated (if undrained). Wetness and associated reducing conditions are indicated by grey colours and reddish mottles. The wetness is caused by perching of water on a clay-enriched slowly permeable layer, although a groundwater-table may also be present.
