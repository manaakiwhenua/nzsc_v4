# Granular Soils

## Concept of the Order

Granular soils are clayey soils in which kaolin-group minerals are dominant, and are usually associated with vermiculite and hydrous-interlayered vermiculite. The soil fabric comprises polyhedral peds with strength characteristics which change rapidly with water content. Consistence is sticky and plastic. The presence of vermiculite gives these soils a moderate buffer capacity. The soils lack the weak strength, friable failure, low plasticity, and low-activity-clay properties which either define or are accessory to Oxidic Soils. Clay coatings where they occur are thin.

## Correlation

The order comprises many soils previously classified as brown granular loams and moderately to strongly leached brown granular clays of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. Most are correlated with the Ultisols but a few with the Alfisols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence

Granular Soils are only known to occur in the northern North Island, particularly in the lowlands of the Waikato and South Auckland regions.

## Accessory Properties of the Order

  1.  _Moderate activity clay._ CEC is greater than 16 cmol/kg (clay) and ECEC ranges from about 8 to 16 cmol/kg (clay).
  2.  _Parent materials._ The soils are derived predominantly from strongly weathered tephras mostly older than 50 000 years, but also from basaltic and andesitic rocks with possible additions from aeolian material.
  3.  _Kandic mineralogy._ Granular Soils usually belong to the Kandic mineralogy class.
  4. _Slowly permeable._ Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow or marginally slow somewhere in the profile, resulting in periods of perching of water.
  5. _Limited root depth._ The extension of plant roots in subsoils is commonly limited by either high penetration resistance, wetness or aluminium toxicity.
  6. _Limited workability when wet._ Workability and trafficability is constrained by stickiness and plasticity after heavy rainfall, particularly in contrast to Oxidic Soils.
  7. _Low phosphorus status._ Phosphorus fixation may be high, as indicated by high P retention levels.
  8. _Strongly weathered with low nutrient reserves._ Reserves of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are low, particularly in the Oxidic group.
  9. _Sulphate in B horizons._ Sulphate tends to be strongly adsorbed in B horizons.

## Key to Groups of Granular Soils

### __NP__

Granular soils that have both 

  1.  a gley profile form, and
  2.  perch-gley features.

<div style="text-align: right"> PERCH-GLEY GRANULAR SOILS </div>

### __NE__

Other Granular soils that have pH of 5.9 or more in the major part of the B horizon to 60 cm from the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> MELANIC GRANULAR SOILS </div>

### __NX__

Other Granular soils that have a cutanoxidic horizon more than 30 cm thick with an upper boundary at 25 cm or more from the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> OXIDIC GRANULAR SOILS </div>

### __NO_

## Key to Subgroups of Granular Soils

### __NP__ PERCH-GLEY GRANULAR SOILS

Perch-gley Granular Soils occur in sites that are periodically saturated (if undrained). Wetness and associated reducing conditions are indicated by grey colours and reddish mottles. The wetness is caused by perching of water on a clay-enriched slowly permeable layer, although a groundwater-table may also be present.

#### __NPX__

Perch-gley Granular Soils that have a cutanoxidic horizon more than 30 cm thick with an upper boundary below 25 cm from the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> Oxidic Perch-gley Granular Soils </div>

#### __NPA__

Other soils that have pH 5.1 or less in some part of the B horizon to 60 cm from the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> Acidic Perch-gley Granular Soils </div>

Melanic Granular Soils are less acid and more fertile than other Granular Soils. Base saturation exceeds 50% in part of the root zone.
