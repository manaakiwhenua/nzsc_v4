These technical terms, printed here in italics, are defined in this book in the section Diagnostic horizons and other differentiae.\nFurther details and other technical terms are defined or can be found in the resources noted below:\n\nHorizon notations are based on Clayden and Hewitt (1989), Clayden and Hewitt (2015), recently updated in O’Brien et al. (2025).\nSoil morphology terms are defined by O’Brien et al. (2025).\nClasses of Soil Taxonomy are defined by Soil Survey Staff (1999) and Soil Survey Staff (2022).\nSoil colours are defined by Pantone (2017); see also Bigham and Ciolkosz (1993) for application of colour in soil science.\nControl sections are designated parts of the soil profile/pedon, denoted as a depth, depth range, or thickness, in which specified diagnostic features occur to enable a soil to be categorised at each level in the classification. For example, a certain feature must occur “within 30 cm of the mineral surface” or a specific soil will have “a layer or layers of allophanic soil material that total 35 cm or more thick … within 60 cm of the mineral soil surface.”\nA lithological discontinuity is a stratigraphic break in a soil profile/pedon that is the result of a geological (not pedological) process or event. The deposition of new geological material, such as a tephra layer or an alluvial or colluvial deposit, forms a new parent material/lithology at the land surface, burying the antecedent soil. The stratigraphic break is normally marked by textural, mineralogical, and other compositional differences between the earlier and later lithologies (Palmer et al. 2025).\nSoil mineralogy terms are explained, and the methods of clay mineral analysis, are described by are defined by Churchman (1986) and Whitton and Churchman (1987) with updated overviews of soil mineralogy by Churchman and Lowe (2012) and Churchman and Velde (2019).\nSoil mineraology classes originally proposed bby Whitton and Childs (1989) and Childs and Whitton (1990) are now also defined in Soil Survey Staff (2022). Note that the soil mineralogy class names given here are based on the following control section: 25 cm to 100 cm or to a lithic or paralithic contact if shallower.\nSoil chemical terms are explained, and the analytical methods are described by Blakemore et al. (1987). Note that soil pH measurements are made in water with a ratio of 1 part of soil to 2.5 parts of water, by weight.\nSoil physical terms are explained and the analytical methods are described by Gradwell and Birrell (1979), McQueen (1993), and Allbrook (1983); Allbrook (1985)\nA comprehensive overview of the diversity of soils and their properties, origins and associated landscapes in Aotearoa New Zealand, on an order-by-order basis, is given by Hewitt et al.

    "text": "1.1 Evolution of New Zealand soils\nThe New Zealand Soil Classification broadly traces the evolution, or genesis, of New Zealand soils through time (Hewitt 1998). Figure 1.1 shows major pathways in the evolution of New Zealand soils. The pathways represent only those likely to have occurred over extensive areas, with many minor pathways or interlinkages omitted for clarity. In mineral parent materials, Raw Soils develop mostly into Recent Soils. The nature of the parent material then strongly determines the subsequent soil genesis pathway. Later, parent material becomes less important, and climate and vegetation, along with time, become more important controls over the character of the soil that evolves (Hewitt 1998; Hewitt et al. 2021).\nIn terms of soil order frequency in New Zealand, Brown Soils are most common (43%), followed by Podzol (13%), Pallic (12%), Pumice (7%), Recent (6%) and Allophanic (5%). The other nine orders account for the remaining 14% with Oxidic and Anthropic the least common with &lt;1% each.\nSoil formation, in its traditionally recognised form, proceeds by modifying a pre-existing parent material according to soil forming factors that dictate a range of processes and their impacts (Simonson 1959). In this situation, the soil profile originates via two steps: step 1, accumulation (or exhumation) of a fresh parent material at the land surface, followed by step 2, the modification of the parent material by soil-forming processes and weathering to form soil horizons leading to a deepening of the soil profile. However, the outcomes of this classical model of ‘topdown pedogenesis’ are modified when geological deposits (e.g., alluvium, tephra, loess, colluvium) are simultaneously added to the surface as it is commonly the case in New Zealand landscapes. Here, step 1 and step 2 occur together (not sequentially) so that the soil profile deepens as the land surface rises over time. This situation, when topdown pedogenesis occurs concomitantly with surface deposition, is called ‘upbuilding pedogenesis’ (Johnson et al. 1990). The concept of upbuilding pedogenesis was recognised in New Zealand more than 90 years ago (Taylor 1933), but it is only in comparatively recent times that it has become more fully appreciated. The deposition at the surface may be incremental (developmental upbuilding pedogenesis) or may comprise the sudden deposition of a relatively thick deposit that buries and isolates the antecedent soil (retardant upbuilding pedogenesis) (Hartemink et al. 2020; Palmer et al. 2025). Upbuilding pedogenesis is captured in the New Zealand Soil Classification mainly through the recognition of lithologic discontinuities and buried horizons (paleosols) in soil profiles, which demand specific notations (Clayden and Hewitt 2015) often indicated in the text by the term ‘buried’ (e.g., Buried-allophanic Orthic Pumice Soil). Upbuilding pedogenesis is predominant to common in Allophanic, Pumice, Pallic, Raw, Recent, Gley, Podzol and Brown soils, and various other soils also exhibit upbuilding pedogenesis to some degree (Hewitt et al. 2021).",

    "text": "1.2 The history of the New Zealand Soil Classification\nThe 4th edition of the Zealand Soil Classification is the culmination of a period of development from its initiation in 1983 to wide circulation of preliminary draft versions 1.0 and 2.0 (Hewitt 1987a; Hewitt 1989) for comment and testing before the revised version 3.0 (Hewitt 2010) was formally published in 1992 (Hewitt 1992a), reviewed by (Lowe 1992). The latest edition represents the best attempt, given the current state of knowledge, to classify New Zealand soils. As the knowledge and understanding of New Zealand soils grows, further revisions will be necessary.\nThe New Zealand Soil Classification is a national three-tier soil classification that replaced the New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification (Soil Bureau Staff 1948; Taylor and Cox 1957; Taylor and Pohlen 1962a; Taylor and Pohlen 1968)1. The New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification grew out of the need for reconnaissance mapping of the nation’s soil resources. It was successful as a unifying factor in New Zealand soil science, and it played a vital role in the development of pastoral agriculture. However, modern soil surveys and land evaluations required precise definition of classes and keys for their recognition. Furthermore, a new synthesis was needed of the large body of information collected since the 1950s (Hewitt 1992b). The first edition developed from the New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification and preserved various parts of it. Since then, the New Zealand Soil Classification has further evolved through experience in using the earlier editions and new knowledge. It has also been influenced by experience in testing the first edition of Soil Taxonomy (Leamy et al. 1983; Leamy et al. 1990; Hewitt 1992c), and the development of subsequent versions of Soil Taxonomy including the most recent edition and keys (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Soil Survey Staff 2022). With the 4th edition we also introduce an extended appendix that now includes an additional soil order (i.e., the Cryic Soil Order) and associated diagnostic criteria. This is to accommodate the soils of the Ross Sea Region of Antarctica, a focal point of Antarctic soil research with leading contributions of New Zealand soil scientists. It addresses the anomaly of New Zealand workers having to use international classifications when working in Antarctica. If, in the future, more empirical evidence emerges that taxa of the Cryic Soil Order might also be applicable to New Zealand soil environments (e.g., alpine environments of the Southern Alps), it can be shifted to the top of the main soil order key.",

Classes must be correlated with Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Soil Survey Staff 2022) to support international extension.",

    "section": "1.5 The soil individual",
    "text": "1.5 The soil individual\nThe soil individual is the fundamental unit of soil which is assigned to classes. Cline (1949) defined an individual as “the smallest natural body that can be defined as a thing complete in itself”.\nSoil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) regards the polypedon as the soil individual. This is rejected here because, as discussed by Hewitt (1982), it does not fulfil the requirements for a soil individual by Cline (1949) or Johnson (1963). In New Zealand, the soil individual has traditionally been the soil profile. Usually conceived as a two-dimensional section exposed by a soil pit, it is in fact a three-dimensional slice sufficiently thick to sample and examine hand specimens. It should therefore be termed a “soil profile slice”. With the realisation that soils should be examined in successive horizontal sections as well as the vertical profile, there is increasing acceptance that a volume of soil the size of the pedon Soil Survey Staff (1999) represents a better soil individual than the soil profile slice.\nAccordingly, the pedon as defined in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1975) and referred to as “a unit of sampling” by (Soil Survey Staff 1999) is recommended as the soil individual for the New Zealand Soil Classification. It is understood that assignments are often made from the examination of volumes of soil smaller than a complete pedon, where they are assumed representative of the pedon. Notwithstanding this definition, it is noted that an alternative concept of the pedon was proposed by Holmgren (1988), this concept now forming in part the basis for digital soil mapping and thus also applying to parts of New Zealand’s soil survey online database, S-map: “A pedon is the possibility for soil observation in respect to a geographic point location. It can be realized by a set of observational propositions, each spatially and temporally specified in relation to that location”.",

    "text": "1.6 How to assign a soil to Subgroup level\nNormally, a soil pit must be dug of sufficient size to expose the soil horizons to about 1 m depth, or to rock if shallower.\nThe soil horizons are examined and the assignment is then made by following the key, starting with the Key to Orders. The “Diagnostic Horizons and Other Differentiae” section is consulted as necessary to identify diagnostic horizons and other differentia, which will be applied according to a specified control section. For some classes, pH or other chemical measurements must be made. The characteristics of the soil are compared with the key statements of each soil order, starting with Organic Soils and passing down the key to the first soil order that fits them. When a soil order is identified, the chapter concerning that order is consulted and the keys to soil groups and soil subgroups are followed in the same manner to identify the appropriate soil group and subgroup. Note that in the keys to the groups and subgroups, the soils, following usage in Soil Taxonomy, are generally listed from more to least problematic in terms of most agricultural or horticultural land uses. For example, in Allophanic Soils, Perch-gley Allophanic Soils are listed first in the group keys, and Ironstone Perch-gley Allophanic Soils head the list in the subgroup keys, with subsequent taxa in each section having decreasing limitations for agriculture. Further, the word ‘typic’ does not necessarily mean the most extensive or typical; rather, it is a taxon representing soils without any of the characteristics defined for other taxa in the same class, (i.e., with no aberrant properties). Being placed last in the keys, it is in effect a default class. Similarly, the word ‘orthic’, meaning normal, conventional, represents a soil with no special qualities worthy of separate taxon status. It is not necessarily the most common taxon.\nThe name given to a soil assigned to a subgroup is made up of three elements in the sequence: subgroup, group, and order (for example, Nodular Perch-gley Oxidic Soils). Note that “Perch-gley”, being hyphenated, is one word, thereby conforming to these nomenclatural rules. Figure 1.2 illustrates the relationships between subgroups and groups in the Oxidic Soils order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The hierarchy of the Oxidic Soils as an example of the hierarchical relationships between orders, groups and subgroups. As the diagram suggests, the range of soil properties for each class is related to hierarchical position.",

    "section": "1.7 Soil series, families and siblings",
    "text": "1.7 Soil series, families and siblings\nIt is possible to classify soils to a more detailed level than the subgroup. Historically, these were called soil series and originally constituted a grouping of soils with similar modal profiles, similar temperature and moisture regimes and the same or very similar parent materials and associated landforms (Taylor and Pohlen 1979). Consequently, soils in a series would usually behave in a similar way for land management. Identified by a geographical name, various subdivisions of a series including soil type (used commonly as a map unit) would carry the same name. Later this definition changed slightly, and soil series were defined according to three main criteria: the nature of the parent material or substrate, particle-size characteristics and the permeability profile (Hewitt 1992c). Because series were primarily used to describe natural soil-landscape units, the within-series variability could be significant and encompass soil properties including texture, stoniness, and depth to bedrock (Taylor and Pohlen 1979). As a result, pedons that traditionally belonged to the same soil series may today be classified into different subgroups. The formal definition and correlation of new soil series ceased in the early 1990s, but the existing series are still widely known and used by scientists, administrators and land users. Since then, soil series have been superseded by soil families. These are primarily used within the context of New Zealand’s soil survey database, S-map, and follow stricter classification rules based on the soil pedon characteristics than it was the case for soil series. A 5th level, the soil sibling (roughly equivalent to soil type), was introduced to further refine the description of the physical attributes within a family. Together, soil family and sibling are the soil entity (i.e., map unit) depicted in S-map. The definition and criteria of the 4th and 5th levels of soil classification are described in detail by Webb and Lilburne (2011).",

The key is merely a means of allocating soils to these classes, and by its nature is imperfect because only a sample of all the possible soils that might potentially be allocated were used in developing the key. Consequently, soils will be found that are not allocated to the appropriate class by the key. This will be apparent when a soil, allocated to a class, does not conform to the concept and accessory statements that can normally be made about that class. Because the key is the servant of the classes, the allocator is justified in placing the soil misfit into a more appropriate class. If this is done, however, it must be registered with the person with responsibility for the national soil classification system, so that appropriate adjustments may be made to the key when the soil classification is next revised. An allocation contrary to the key must also be noted in any records or publication of the allocation.",

Despite this, correlations can be made where classes are substantially equivalent. It is likely that all orders of Soil Taxonomy are represented in New Zealand, albeit some uncommonly or rarely, although Gelisols have not yet been formally identified Table 1.1.\nTable 1.2 summarises the correlations of classes of the New Zealand Soil Classification with those of the New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification (Taylor and Pohlen 1968) and Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Soil Survey Staff 2022).

The definitions are not intended to represent a comprehensive classification of horizons.\nThe following diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics have been modified from Soil Taxonomy Soil Survey Staff (1999): argillic horizon, duripan, fragipan, lithic contact, paralithic contact and placic horizon.\nTransitional horizons (e.g. AB or A/B horizons) are not included when considering horizon notations for New Zealand Soil Classification criteria unless explicitly stated. Note that:\nAllophanic soil material has soil properties dominated by nanocrystalline minerals (structured at the nanometre scale, previously termed short-range order), namely allophane and ferrihydrite. Imogolite, which comprises long, thin hollow nanotubes, and thus has both long- and short-range order, may occur with allophane but usually in small amounts. Other terms such as “amorphous”, “poorly crystalline” and “non-crystalline”, have been previously used for such minerals but in most cases are no longer valid (Churchman and Lowe 2012). Their chief characteristics are reactive variable-charge surfaces, and a very high specific surface area (several hundreds of m2/g).\nAllophanic soil material has BOTH\nLayers meeting the requirements of allophanic soil material may also meet the requirements of vitric soil material.\nAccessory chemical properties relate to variable-charge characteristics, P retention, and high organic-matter contents. Accessory physical properties include high total available water capacity and readily available water capacity, and low penetration resistance. In addition, allophanic soil material undergoes irreversible changes upon drying, for example, in plastic and liquid limits and in apparent particle-size distribution. It should be noted that minerals other than allophane (e.g. ferrihydrite) can give rise to allophanic soil material.",

    "section": "Anthropic Soil Material",
    "text": "Anthropic Soil Material\nAnthropic soil material constitutes human-altered or human-transported soil material that shows evidence of the purposeful modification of soil properties or of surface features by human activity. The field evidence of alteration excludes low-impact practices that still allow the soil to meet the requirements of other soil orders (e.g., shallow cultivation, ploughing, the addition of amendments). Artifically drained soils/wetlands are also not included here because it is difficult to unambiguously link artificial drainage to specific, field-identifiable soil indicators. The nature of alteration can comprise profile truncation, mixing, inversion, deposition of transported material, and addition of artefacts. Due to the high variability of the morphological or chemical soil properties that can result from human soil modifications, the criteria of anthropic soil material are mainly linked to their anthropic genesis, and thus deviate from the principles of the New Zealand Soil Classification. Common indicators of anthropic soil material are:\n\nexcavated or constructed landforms,\nmechanically detached, redistributed, and re-oriented soil material,\nabraded and broken rock fragments that do not correspond with the fragments in the underlying soil material (e.g., fractures that cut through rather than between individual minerals),\npresence of manufactured materials of any kind and age\nwaste products associated with human activities (e.g., food, manufacturing, construction, mining)\nCultural/religious activity linked to soil (e.g., burial sites).\n\nThe relationship between natural soil horizons or parent materials with anthropic soil material or truncation is commonly in the form of a lithological discontinuity, indicated by abrupt or sharp transitions between horizons. The majority of anthropic soil material (including truncation) in New Zealand is the result of distinct and extensive modification from the mid-19th century coinciding with early European settlement, deforestation, and farming. From the mid-20th century, excavation and construction (e.g., infrastructure, roading, industrial and urban expansion) has increasingly intensified these impacts on our soils. The influence of ‘older’ Māori cultural practice (e.g., soil alteration/modification practices, Māori plaggen soils (Puke 2021)) is still recognised in many parts of New Zealand, and can predate European settlement.",

The latter are preferred, but the use of a spray bottle to apply the solution should definitely be avoided due to the toxicity of the reagent. The development of a red or pink colour indicates a positive reaction (i.e., reduced conditions), normally within about 30 minutes (Schoeneberger et al. 2012).

The dominant clays are kaolin group minerals, and clay coatings occur on less than 10% of ped faces. Exchangeable aluminium, as a percentage of CEC, is usually greater than 25% (and is frequently more than 50% in some part of the horizon). It has ALL the following characteristics:\n\nIt meets the requirements of a cutanic horizon, AND\nIt is a B horizon that is clayey and has polyhedral peds 2-6 mm; AND\nSoil materials lack the characteristic friable failure over a wide range in moisture contents that is exhibited by oxidic horizons. The horizon has a failure class of friable only at water contents close to field capacity. Small changes in water content from field capacity result in large changes in soil strength and failure. Semi-deformable failure occurs at water contents wetter than field capacity. Very firm or stronger ped strength with brittle failure occurs at soil water matric potentials drier than about 30 kPa; AND\nSoil materials are sticky and very plastic, in comparison to oxidic materials which are only slightly sticky in relation to their clay content; AND\nPeds have smooth faces with silt-sized aggregates of iron oxide crystallites which give the faces a dusty appearance when dry. The latter property in particular distinguishes this horizon from horizons developed in well-drained Brown Soils.\n\nThe significance of this horizon lies in the combination of low ECEC, clay illuviation, acidity and physical properties different to that of oxidic horizons.",

It is likely that the iron has been precipitated from iron-rich groundwater moving laterally. In Taranaki (Childs et al. 1990), the pans are porous and some appear to have formed as iron-oxide rhizomorphs, which have been progressively infilled and welded together by further precipitations of iron oxide. In these pans the mineralogy is dominated by varying proportions of goethite and ferrihydrite.\nIronstone-pans are not usually associated with eluvial horizons and do not occur in Podzols. They differ from ortstein-pans and placic horizons which are often associated with eluvial horizons in Podzol or Brown Soils, and which have high organic carbon levels. Ironstone pans meet the requirements of the material below a petroferric contact of Soil Taxonomy.\nThe pans are a barrier to plant roots.

    "text": "Saline soil material\nSoil salinity refers to the accumulation of water-soluble salts, mainly of sodium, calcium and magnesium. These can severely affect plant growth and land use, and increase soil erosion (Craw and Rufaut 2024).\nMost soils generate some salt as a product of chemical weathering, with composition and concentration determined by the parent material lithology. Soils may also receive additional salt at their surface, transported by wind and/or rain. These salts accumulate as crystals in the soil profile or on the soil surface when rainfall is too low to dissolve and remove them. Some soils are affected by saline groundwater from marine or hydrothermal sources.\nSoil salinity is somewhat difficult to measure in the field in ways that can be strongly related to plant growth (DERM 2011). As a compromise, the electrical conductivity (EC) of a 1:5 solution of soil to deionised water is measured. Results exceeding 0.8 mS/cm within in the top 60 cm of the soil profile are considered significant enough to be considered in the classification of Gley, Recent, Raw and Semi-Arid soil orders.\nNote that salinity at any given location (including within the profile) is expected to be highly variable across seasons and will generally be at its maximum towards the end of a dry summer.",

    "text": "Sulfidic soil material\nSulfidic soil materials contain more than 0.01% (dry mass) inorganic sulfide sulfur, mainly in the form of pyrite (FeS2) as very fine crystals. These sulfides are stable under anaerobic conditions but will otherwise rapidly oxidise, releasing sulfuric acid. Their field pH in water will usually be neutral to mildly alkaline, but pH in hydrogen peroxide may drop as low as 2 after a vigorous reaction (O’Brien et al. 2025). These paired field pH tests may be used as an initial pre-screening test for inorganic sulfides, but are not definitive on their own. In the field, sulfidic soil material will be waterlogged and will meet the criterium of a reductimorphic horizon with a hue of 5Y or less red, or black if organic material or metasulfides are dominant.\nSulfidic soil materials can be split into hyper- and hypo- sulfidic subclasses. Methods for determining these subclasses may be found in Sullivan et al. (2018).\nHypersulfidic soil material has a high acidification risk. These materials become sulfuric soil material when disturbed.\nHyposulfidic soil material has a lower acidification risk due to the presence of substances that buffer the acidity released upon oxidation of sulfides (e.g., carbonates). These materials will not become sulfuric soil material when disturbed, but may affect water quality by mobilisation of metals.\nSulfidic soil materials are most commonly silt- or clay-textured, but can still be sandy or even gravelly under specific depositional conditions. They sometimes contain elevated organic matter and may even comprise marine-influenced peats. Sulfidic soil materials are predominantly found near the land surface in low-energy coastal environments and buried at depth under floodplains. They require anaerobic conditions, active sulfate-reducing bacteria, a supply of iron and sulfate, and enough groundwater movement to remove reaction products and sustain the activity of the iron sulfide accumulation process (Rijkse 1978).\nNote that there is potential for sulfidic soil material to underly soils of soil orders that do not currently contain sulfidic subgroups. This can apply to any soil in a near-coastal depositional landscape at low elevation (&lt;20 m as guidance), provided the required conditions are present. This material will most often be buried deeper than 1 m. These deeply buried materials remain out of scope for the classification.",

They occur mostly in well drained tephra-dominated parent materials, including basaltic tephra (such as ash or scoriae). Allophanic Soils, in many places, comprise multilayered profiles with one or more lithological discontinuities and buried soil horizons or paleosols that reflect their origins via upbuilding pedogenesis. They occur also in well-drained quartzo-feldspathic and tuffaceous (greywacke) sandstone and derivatives.",

    "section": "4.4 Accessory Properties of the Order",
    "text": "4.4 Accessory Properties of the Order\n\nNanocrystalline minerals. The soil matrix as well as pore surfaces are dominated by the clay minerals allophane, ferrihydrite, imogolite, and/or aluminium-humus complexes. The soil materials have very high specific surface area. Measured clay contents generally range from 10 to 25% though particle-size measurements can be difficult because of aggregation and the “true” or primary clay contents may often be considerably higher. P retention is high or very high.\nLow bases. Sum of bases are low to very low and range from less than 1 to 10 cmolc/100 g in subsoils and unfertilised topsoils.\nMainly pyroclastic (tephra) parent materials. Predominantly in andesitic, rhyolitic or mixed tephra (and reworked derivatives), and in basaltic scoriae, they also occur in soil materials from sandstone (greywacke), or derivatives, of humid uplands and high country. According to proximity to volcanic sources, they often comprise multilayered profiles reflecting deposition of different tephra layers through time.\nRapid, hydrolytic mineral weathering. Volcanic glass, feldspars, and mafic minerals dominate the sand fractions of soils in pyroclastic parent materials, and are the primary source of the nanocrystalline minerals. Feldspars are most likely the primary source in non-pyroclastic parent materials. Typically they have Amorphic, Ferrihydritic, or Glassy mineralogy classes.\nRapid permeability and high water retention. The macroporosity is very high and rapid drainage occurs at low soil moisture tensions. Water contents at 1500 kPa soil moisture tension are very high.\nWell drained. Although poorly, imperfectly and moderately well drained soils occur, well drained soils are predominant. Good drainage allows the key mechanism of desilication to occur that favours the formation of allophane and ferrihydrite.\nGood rooting medium. Bulk density is very low and there is little resistance to root extension. In many soils the potential rooting depth is very deep.\nActive soil fauna. Microbial biomass is generally high.\nStable topsoils. Soils resist pugging under the impact of machinery or grazing animals in wet weather. The water content at field capacity is less than the plastic limit. Topsoil and subsoil horizons are friable, and organic/mineral complexes are stable. For mineral soils, carbon contents are medium to very high. Exposed topsoil may be subject to wind erosion.\nHigh shrinkage potential. Soil materials have high potential to shrink on drying. Rewetting may not achieve the original volume.\nSlight to insignificant erosion under pasture. Generally the erosion potential is low, except on steep slopes or exposed sites and under cultivation on rolling slopes.\nSensitive. A pronounced loss of strength occurs on disturbance.\nLimited fertility. There are usually requirements for phosphorus, potassium and magnesium on dairy farms. There are no significant trace element deficiencies although cobalt is marginal in more strongly leached Allophanic Soils. Pasture may respond to lime where pH is less than 5.3. Sulfate reserves are held in B horizons. P retention and phosphate fixation are high in topsoils.\nMoist climate. Precipitation exceeds 1000 mm and soil moisture deficits are either absent or occur for only short periods.",

This includes the truncation (i.e. excavation) of natural soils by earth-moving equipment, the relocation of soils from their original sites, or the mixing of natural soils in a way that significantly alters their original character. Additionally, Anthropic soils may be formed through the deposition of thick layers of organic matter or inorganic material that may also contain artefacts. Their classification reflects the way in which they were created or altered, and the kinds of materials used.\nIf the original soil type is known to at least order level, it has to be appended to the taxa name in parentheses. If unknown, this also has to be stated as parentheses, for example, ‘Typic Truncated Anthropic Soil (unknown soil)’ or ‘Typic Mixed Anthropic Soil (Perch-gley Pallic Soil)’. Evidence of the likely original soil type can be sourced from legacy soil maps (also geological maps, aerial imagery, etc.), and by correlation with non-anthropic soils found in a similar geomorphological context (e.g., non-Anthropic Soils of the same landform).\nNote that soils that have been drastically disturbed but have been restored to the extent that they will meet the requirements of orders other than Recent Soils or Raw Soils, will not be assigned to Anthropic Soils. For this reason Anthropic soils are placed late in the Key to Orders but before Recent Soils and Raw Soils.",

Examples include pā sites, trenches, terraces, cultural fortifications, papa kāinga (villages), ūrupa (burial sites). For gardening, horticulture, and cropping soil management practices result in the addition of local mineral material (e.g., rock fragments and sand) or the addition of organic or biogenic material (e.g., seaweed, charcoal, [fire] ash, shells), to ameliorate and enhance the physical, chemical, and biological properties of a soil (e.g., soil fertility, drainage, aeration, temperature).

P retention is moderate to very high.\nLow to moderate base saturation. Base saturation values in subsoils are usually less than 50%, and KCl-extractable aluminium levels are usually more than 1.5 cmolc/kg except where clay contents are relatively low.\nParent materials are mostly weakly weathered. Mafic Brown Soils are derived from weakly weathered intermediate or mafic igneous rocks (e.g. phonolite and basalt). Other groups are derived dominantly from quartzo-feldspathic sedimentary rocks (schist and greywacke) or felsic igneous rocks (e.g. rhyolites and granites), or derivatives including loess or aeolian sand. The alteration status of rock fragments or hard rock substrates is usually fresh to moderately weathered and occasionally highly weathered.\nMica/illite and vermiculite are common clay minerals. Profiles tend to be mineralogically uniform with depth. Brown Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes. Mixed, Illitic, Vermiculitic and Clay-mineralic (involving vermiculite and mica-vermiculite) are common. Some Allophanic Brown Soils have an Amorphic mineralogy class.\nGood Drainage.

Redox segregations of iron and manganese oxides, however, are usually present elsewhere in the soil and may occupy large volumes.\nCommonly formed in alluvial or colluvial parent materials. Soils most frequently occur in relatively low parts of the landscape, in hollows or associated with rushes.\nWide range of clay minerals. The clay mineralogy commonly reflects the mineralogy of the non-gleyed material from which the soils are derived. Gley Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes with Mixed, Illitic, and Smectitic being the most common.\nPoorly or very poorly drained. Topsoils have relatively high levels of organic matter and some are peaty. Subsurface horizons to depth are dominantly grey or bluish grey in colour (i.e., low-chroma colours) with strong brown to dark brown redox segregations.\nHigh groundwater-tables. Most are affected by high groundwater-tables, at least throughout winter months. Soils with slowly permeable layers may also be subject to perching.\nShallow potential rooting depth. Potential rooting depth is limited by poor aeration. Even after drainage, root extension may be limited in some horizons.\nRelatively high bulk densities. Bulk densities are likely to be higher than in well drained soils in similar soil materials.\nLimited trafficability. Trafficability is limited in most soils when wet and pugging damage by stock is likely.\nResponse to drainage. Crops, not adapted to wetness, respond well to drainage.\nMinimal erosion. Flooding or ponding of water is likely on low-lying sites, especially on floodplains. Deposition of fresh sediment is possible in these sites.\nNitrogen requirement. Nitrogen requirements are likely to be higher than for associated well drained soils.",

The soil material comprises polyhedral peds with strength characteristics which change rapidly with water content. Consistence is sticky and plastic. The presence of vermiculite gives these soils a moderate buffering capacity. The soils lack the weak strength, friable failure, low plasticity, and low-activity-clay properties which either define or are accessory to Oxidic Soils. Clay coatings where they occur are thin.",

The extension of plant roots in subsoils is commonly limited by either high penetration resistance, wetness or aluminium toxicity.\nLimited workability when wet. Workability and trafficability is constrained by stickiness and plasticity after heavy rainfall, particularly in contrast to Oxidic Soils. Granular Soils in the Pukekohe area are generally somewhat less constrained than equivalent soils in the Waikato area.\nLow phosphorus status.

The organic components of Organic Soils have high surface area, and high negative charge that varies markedly with pH. CEC values are very high, mostly ranging from 40 to 170 cmolc/kg.\nHigh carbon/nitrogen ratios. C/N ratios range from 18 to as high as 70 in unfertilised and uncultivated Organic Soils.\nLow bearing strength. Construction of buildings or roads requires special foundation design.\nVery low thermal conductivity. Soils warm and cool slowly. Bare soil surfaces, however, have high radiance.\nHigh shrinkage potential. The soils shrink markedly upon drying, and lose organic matter due to oxidation. Consequently, following drainage, the classification may change.\nHigh total available water capacity. While total available water capacity is high, plant-available water capacity may only be moderate, due to limits in rooting depth (anoxic conditions, species-specific limitations).\nCommon nutrient deficiencies. The major nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur, and the trace elements copper, selenium and molybdenum, are frequently deficient for crops and pasture.\nPeats are very poorly drained, litters are variable. In their natural state, Organic Soils formed in peats are very poorly drained and those formed from litters may range from well drained to very poorly drained. Most Organic Soils from peat in New Zealand have been artificially drained, leading to drastic shifts towards drier soil moisture conditions.",

The soils are weakly buffered. Some subhorizons have a net positive charge. Oxidic Soils usually have the following mineralogy classes: Kandic, Ferritic or Aluminitic/Gibbsitic.\nHigh phosphate retention. P-retention ranges from 60 to 90%. High sulfate adsorption occurs in B horizons.\nParent materials. The soils are derived from andesites, dolerites and basalts of mid-Pleistocene age or older.\nLimited rooting depth. The extension of plant roots is limited by high dry bulk density and high penetration resistance, particularly in well drained soils. Plant root depths are shallow to medium.\nModerate or rapid infiltration. Hydraulic conductivity of surface horizons and upper B horizons is moderate or faster, giving excellent trafficability and workability immediately after rain.\nSlow permeability. Hydraulic conductivity decreases to slow or marginally slow values with depth, such that perching of water occurs within the root zone after high intensity rainfalls. The duration of wetness varies from 1 to 2 days in well drained soils to 4 days or more in poorly drained soils.\nSoil water deficit. Deficits occur in summer and are exacerbated by low readily available water capacities and shallow rooting depths.\nHigh clay contents. Clay content ranges from 50 to 90%.\nWell-developed structure. Topsoils have mostly well developed spheroidal or polyhedral peds. Topsoil bulk densities are low.\nStrongly weathered with very low nutrient reserves.

Podzol Soils have a horizon of aluminium accumulation occurring as complexes with organic matter and/or as nanocrystalline minerals including allophane (with some imogolite) that result from the translocation of silicon as well as aluminium in solution as proto-imogolite. Iron (typically as ferrihydrite) may or may not accumulate with aluminium and silicon. This podzolic-B horizon is usually associated with an overlying eluvial horizon indicating translocation. The podzolic-B horizon can develop into a placic horizon or ortstein-pan if cementation occurs. The eluvial horizon may be missing due to erosion, ploughing, or bioturbation, or it may be masked by organic matter.",

In B horizons they are coated, and in some soils cemented, by short-range-order minerals and/or organic matter.\nLow base saturation. Base saturations are very low, and the soils are extremely acidic, in A and E horizons. KCl-extractable-aluminium levels are high, and aluminium in soil solution may be toxic to some plants.\nParent materials. The soils occur mainly in materials from felsic rocks such as granite, greywacke, schist or rhyolite, and derivatives including loess and tephra deposits.\nMineralogically differentiated. Mica-smectite or smectite often occur in A and E horizons, and hydroxy-coated or interlayered minerals or allophane often occur in the B horizon. In some Northland soils, silica is dominant in B horizons. Podzols cover a wide range of mineralogy classes.\nLimited rooting depth. The rooting depth is limited for many introduced plants by low pH or aluminium toxicity, or by pans which often impede drainage.\nLow biological activity. Low levels of faunal activity occur with a low rate of mineralisation. Carbon/nitrogen ratios are very high. The accumulation of weakly decomposed humus and minimal incorporation of humus into the upper mineral soil results in a mor-like humus form.\nMor-forming vegetation. The soils have been associated with vegetation producing an acid litter of low nutrient content (mainly Agathis australis, Nothofagaceae, Podocarpaceae).\nInfertile. The soils have very low natural fertility with high nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime requirements.\nWet climate.

Most Pumice Soils belong to the Glassy or Amorphic mineralogy classes.\nLow soil strength. Soil strength is weak or very weak. The soils have earthy structre, or are apedal single-grain, except where subsoil comprise compact or weakly cemented (non-welded) layers which are apedal massive and may have higher strength.\nPumice is not strongly altered. The alteration status of coarse pumice rock fragments ranges from fresh to moderately weathered. Volcanic glass is predominant in sand fractions.\nDeep rooting. The soils provide a deep rooting medium except in welded ignimbrite.\nVery high macroporosity. The macroporosity enables rapid drainage at low soil-water tensions. The available water capacity is high.\nSensitive. The soils are non-plastic and are sensitive, with low strength when disturbed.\nResistant to pugging. Water contents at field capacity are less than the plastic limit. Pumice Soils may, however, be susceptible to compaction on loading, with consequent reduced infiltration.\nLow reserves of major nutrient elements. Sulfur, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium are usually required for agricultural or horticultural crops. Reserve potassium is low and exchangeable magnesium is very low, particularly in subsoils.\nTrace elements are likely to be deficient. Trace elements that are possibly deficient include cobalt, copper, molybdenum, boron, iodine and selenium.\nErosive. The potential for erosion by water is high.\nMultilayered.

    "text": "17.4 Accessory Properties of the Order\n\nLow secondary oxides. Secondary iron and aluminium oxide levels are very low. Phosphate retention levels are also very low (usually less than 15%).\nHigh base status. Base saturation values in subsoils are high and rise to 100% at the base of the solum.\nParent materials. The soils occur in materials from non-calcareous quartzo-feldspathic schist and indurated sandstone (greywacke), and fluvial and aeolian derivatives including fan and terrace deposits, and loess, respectively.\nIllitic clay mineralogy. Mica/illite clay minerals predominate with trace primary chlorite and kaolinite. Semiarid Soils almost always have an Illitic mineralogy class unless they have a clay content of less than 10% and fall into the Mixed class.\nPermeability. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow in soils with argillic or cutanic horizons, and in some other silty or fine sandy soils. Infiltration may be reduced by machine traffic or stock treading when soils are saturated by irrigation water.\nDrainage. No poorly or very poorly drained soils are included.\nAvailable water capacity. Available water capacity is limited in most subsoils.\nLow biological activity. In the natural state, biological activity is limited by droughtiness.\nHigh slaking and dispersion potential. Soil materials are strongly dispersive and will readily slake.\nErosive. The soils are susceptible to wind and water erosion.\nWeakly buffered. The soils are weakly buffered because of low CEC and anion adsorption capacity. They are consequently very sensitive to management, showing rapid changes in response to fertilisation, irrigation and cultivation.\nSoluble salts. Soluble salts are present in many soils and land management must consider the risk of salinisation.\nHigh sodium. Sodium occupies a large proportion of the cation exchange complex, particularly in Semiarid Soils with argillic horizons.\nClimate. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 350 to 500 mm, with zero water surplus and a spring soil moisture deficit.",

A few are developed in the weathering products of limestones and greensands. They have low potassium, magnesium and phosphorus reserves and contain mostly highly weathered minerals.

    "text": "18.4 Accessory Properties of the Order\n\nAcidity. KCl-extractable aluminium levels of more than 1 cmolc/kg are usual in B horizons, and indicate toxic aluminium which may inhibit root function and may contribute to shallow rooting habits in aluminium-sensitive plants.\nClayey subsoils. CEC values are medium to high. Ultic Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes, Kandic/Halloysitic and Smectitic being the most common.\nLow magnesium and potassium. Low concentrations of reserve magnesium and potassium resulting from strong weathering.\nStrongly weathered with low nutrient reserves. Low levels of 0.5M H2SO4- extractable phosphorus (usually less than 3 mg/100 g) and total phosphorus (usually less than 20 mg/100 g) are characteristic. The former reflects low solubility and/or a low level of inorganic phosphorus reserves. Phosphorus supply from inorganic sources under zero phosphorus input grassland farming is negligible after about 2 years. Strong weathering is indicated by low ratio of 0.5M H2SO4--extractable phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus, usually 0.25 or less.\nSlow permeability. A slowly permeable layer occurs in clayey profiles, in some cases marking a buried paleosol beneath a lithological discontinuity. The majority of soils are imperfectly to poorly drained. Soil water movement is mainly along planar voids.\nSusceptibility to livestock treading damage. Clayey or low strength, silty surface horizons are susceptible to treading damage or compaction during wet periods.\nDispersible surface horizons. Surface horizons, especially silty ones, are dispersible according to the test of McQueen (1981), and are prone to erosion where the surface cover has been removed. Although phosphate retention is usually moderate or high in B horizons, it may be low in A and E horizons consistent with low contents of secondary iron oxides.",

    "text": "Many have contributed to the development of this version, but in particular the guidance and encouragement of Ben Clayden is gratefully acknowledged. Alastair Wilson advanced the work considerably by developing the hierarchies of the Oxidic and Granular Soils orders, the Mafic Brown Soils subgroups and revising the Ultic Soils hierarchy. The Allophanic Soils and Pumice Soils proposals are adapted from the ICOMAND proposal (Parfitt and Clayden 1991) and Roger Parfitt’s assistance with these, and other orders, has been appreciated. There are many others who have willingly supplied information, discussed concepts and helped define classes. In particular I thank Trevor Webb, Robin Palmer, Brian Purdie, Hugh Wilde, Iain Campbell, Geoff Mew, Mike Laffan, Peter McIntosh, Alan Palmer, Jim Pollok, David Lowe, Megan Balks, Bob Allbrook, Malcolm McLeod, Gary Orbell and Peter Singleton. Cyril Childs’ editorial help was also much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\nParfitt RL, Clayden B 1991. Andisols  the development of a new order in Soil Taxonomy.

    "text": "Active layer\nThis is the surface layer of a soil that thaws in summer but is frozen in winter. The depth of the active layer, which can be determined only at time of maximum thaw (and thus is best determined by temperature monitoring), is the maximum depth to which temperatures above zero extend in any given summer season. The active layer depth often varies between seasons. Some workers also recognise a “transition layer” which is the part of the soil above the permafrost that may thaw in some, but not all, summers.\n\n\nDesert Pavement\nDesert Pavement describes a surface cover directly above the mineral soil characterised by closely packed interlocking rock fragments that accumulate at the surface initially by winnowing and removal of the fine earth fraction (&lt;2 mm) by wind action. Over time, Antarctic desert pavement materials may become smaller, highly weathered, ventifacted, and polished.\n\n\nDry-permafrost soil material\nThis is soil material with insufficient moisture (generally &lt;5%) for ice-cement to form when soil temperatures remain below 0°C for at least two consecutive years. Dry-permafrost can be readily excavated using hand tools.\n\n\nIce-cemented material\nThis describes soil material that is bound by ice formed within the soil such that it is not practical to excavate it with hand tools.\n\n\nIce-cored Moraine features\nSoils with this feature contain sub-surface stagnant glacier ice and an overlying layer of ablation till. This is mineral material which has accumulated as a result of sublimation, and melt and evaporation of ice until the mineral layer is thick enough to insulate the underlying ice from further rapid ablation.\n\n\nOrnithogenic Soil Materials\nThese are soil materials that result from the activities of birds, which comprise guano, eggshells, remains of birds including bones and feathers, and nesting materials. Such soil materials are generally high in carbon and phosphorus. Those formed by Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in the Ross Sea Region generally contain a large proportion of 2–5 cm sized coarse rock fragments, which the birds use to construct their nests.\n\n\nPatterned Ground\nPatterned ground occurs where surface soil materials are somewhat sorted because of freezing and contraction during winter and subsequent expansion as temperatures increase in summer. Patterned ground contraction cracks often form surface polygons of up to about 10 m diameter and often have larger stones sorted towards the outer edges of a polygon. The exact shape and size of patterned ground surface features is influenced by the moisture/ice content, particle size distribution of the underlying materials and land surface gradient.\n\n\nPermafrost soil material\nPermafrost constitutes soil material with temperatures that remain below 0°C for at least two consecutive years. Permafrost may comprise ice, rock, regolith, or soil materials.",

    "section": "A.5 Accessory Properties of the Order",
    "text": "A.5 Accessory Properties of the Order\n\n1. Low degree of weathering. Most Cryic Soils are dominated by minimally weathered materials so tend to be coarse-textured. They may contain ice lenses, ice segregations, or massive relict glacier ice, iron oxides and free salts. Clay content, unless clay was a significant component of the parent material, tends to be very low (&lt;5%).\nSeasonal presence of an unfrozen layer. Cryic Soils have a seasonally thawed active layer. Within the Ross Sea Region the depth of the active layer varies from less than 5 cm on some high-altitude inland sites to about 1 m in warm, sheltered, coastal microclimate sites on the margin of the Ross Sea.\nDesert pavement and patterned ground typically cover the soil surface. Within the Ross Sea Region, Frozen Soils are characterised by a surface “desert pavement” of armouring coarse material that protects the underlying material from ongoing surface wind and/or water erosion. On older surfaces, the desert pavement stones may become strongly ventifacted and have a distinct desert varnish coating. Patterned ground develops on many surfaces and is often particularly strongly developed on ice-cored moraine.\nA wide range of different parent materials. Parent materials comprise the locally derived rock materials, often having been moved, mixed, and sorted by glacial, alluvial, or colluvial activity. Mineralogy is usually mixed and ranges from mafic to felsic, derived from the parent materials.\nMinimal organic influence. With exception of Ornithogenic Cryic Soils, soils in the Ross Sea Region have minimal organic matter, though microbes are generally present. There are currently no higher plants, with only occasional occurrences of moss and cyanobacteria in seasonally wet environments and sporadic occurrence of lichens. Cold temperatures, lack of liquid moisture, and at some sites high salt contents, generally limit the capacity of Cryic Soils to support extensive flora or fauna.\nPedogenic salts (i.e., carbonate and non-carbonate salts) accumulate over time. Within the Ross Sea Region, salt coatings are visible on the undersides of surface stones in most soils, forming characteristic pendants. Salts may be visible on the soil surface and on clasts and boulders close to the soil surface where they have accumulated due to evaporation. Some soils have subsurface horizons that are particularly high in salts. There is a wide range of salts reported depending on surface age, parent materials, water availability, and proximity to marine sources of salts. Salt contents are generally higher on older surfaces and in areas where water accumulates then evaporates, such as lake and pond margins. On older inland surfaces the predominant source of nitrate salts is probably accumulation from atmospheric deposition.",

    "text": "A.8 Key to Subgroups of Cryic Soils\n\nCB - ORNITHOGENIC CRYIC SOILS\nOrnithogenic Cryic Soils occur in areas associated with bird ground-nesting sites where there is an accumulation of materials derived from bird activity. They may be in areas where birds are actively nesting, or they may be relict features from sites where nesting has been extensive but is now abandoned. Compared to adjacent areas where intensive bird nesting has not occurred, Ornithogenic Cryic Soils typically have accumulations of organic matter and are enriched in nitrogen, and phosphorus, but also trace elements like cadmium, zinc, and copper that can restrict microbial activity.\n\nCBA\nOrnithogenic Cryic Soils without surface evidence of bird nesting activity over the previous two or more years.\n\nAbandoned Ornithogenic Cryic Soils\n\n\n\nCBT\nOther soils.\n\nTypic Ornithogenic Cryic Soils\n\n\n\n\nCD - DRY-PERMAFROST CRYIC SOILS\nDry-permafrost Cryic Soils occur where evaporation exceeds precipitation and there is insufficient soil moisture (&lt;5%) within the permafrost to form ice-cemented soil material, such that the soils may be readily excavated using hand tools. Dry-permafrost Cryic Soils typically occur on old, higher altitude surfaces and in the driest inland parts of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Dry-permafrost Cryic Soils are likely to show evidence of salt accumulation, with visible subsurface salts present in weathered and ultra-weathered subgroups. Soft Dry-permafrost Cryic Soils occur in topographic areas where snowdrifts and dust tend to settle and fine soil material accumulates.

Orthic Cryic Soils contain ice-cemented soil material. They are often less studied than the Dry-permafrost soils as they are harder to excavate and are often less weathered. All Orthic Cryic Soils, except the Raw subgroup, are likely to contain some salts. Elevated salt accumulation occurs in the weathered subgroup.

    "text": "C.0.1 Major\n\nC.0.1.1 Introduction\n\nADD subsection ‘Evolution of New Zealand Soils’, about the pathways soil development follows in the country\nADD subsection ‘The History of the New Zealand Soil Classification’ recounting how the classification has developed from older classifications.\nThese two sections replace the previous introductory paragraphs.\nADD subsection ‘Soil series, families and siblings’ to explain the history and use of these concepts\n\n\n\nC.0.1.2 Diagnostics\n\nADD clear definitions of the phrases ‘in some part’ and ‘in the major part’ to the top of the chapter.\nRationale these were previously sitting in footnotes within the Allophanic and Brown chapters, making them hard to find.\nADD clear direction about how to handle transitional horizons when classifying a profile\nADD Anthropic Soil Material as a diagnostic for the Anthropic order.\nRationale: Anthropic materials were not previously defined, causing confusion during the classification process.\nADD Child’s test as a diagnostic for reduction in soils.\nRationale: The test was previously mentioned at the subgroup level but not defined in detail. The test is also now described in the ‘field tests’ chapter of the Soil Description Handbook (O’Brien et al. 2025).\nADD Eluvial horizon as a diagnostic for Pallic and some Brown soils.\nRationale: Concepts appearing in the key require a clear diagnostic definition within the classification, independent of the description manual, which was previously implicitly linked.\nADD Low-chroma colours as a diagnostic for many soils affected by poor drainage or strong leaching.\nRationale: The definition of low-chroma colour was previously only available in the definition of a Bg horizon and was therefore hard to find. It is now clearly defined both in this document and in the ‘horizon colour’ chapter of the Soil Description Handbook.\nADD Saline Soil Material as a diagnostic.\nRationale: Elevated soil salinity defines subgroups in the Gley, Semi-Arid, Recent and Raw orders but the concept has not previously been fully explained.\nADD Sulfidic Soil Material as a diagnostic.\nRationale: Sulfidic soils were previously lumped in with less hazardous wet soils and their diagnostic criteria were outdated and only mentioned at subgroup level.\nADD Sulfuric Soil Material as a diagnostic.\nRationale: Sulfuric soils were previously lumped in with less hazardous low-pH soils and their diagnostic criteria were outdated and only mentioned at subgroup level.\nAMEND Calcareous horizon for clarity and brevity, adding a clearer definition of primary vs secondary carbonates and including example horizon notation. Removed extraneous second paragraph.\nRationale: Removal of the second paragraph is justified on the grounds that the content is better suited to the Methods and Rationale of the NZSC (Hewitt 1993).\nAMEND Densipan to include expected horizon notation, and remove reference to specific types of field testing.\nRationale: Strength and penetration resistance testing should be undertaken using current best practices, which do not need to be specified in this document.\nAMEND Fragipan to include expected horizon notation, and remove reference to specific types of field testing. Additionally, clarify that bulk density is expected to be greater than or equal to 1.5 Mg/m3.\nAMEND the table in Reactive Aluminium test to match the new Soil Description Manual and demonstrate more realistic reaction colours.\nREMOVE Crumb structure as a diagnostic.\nRationale: Updated terms for describing this kind of structure have become available in the new Soil Description Manual.\n\n\n\nC.0.1.3 Key\n\nADD A note about how to classify restored Anthropic soils to the top of the key.\nCHANGE the criteria for Recent Soils to allow soils that do not fully meet the criteria for a Distinct Topsoil by only having a ‘structural A’ horizon.\nRationale: This change helps to account for soils that have only a slight colour difference (e.g. visually perceptible darkening but still within the same Munsell chip, or only a Hue shift) in the A horizon due to tillage, low natural organic carbon content, or similar, but are still clearly too developed and in the wrong landscapes for the Raw order to make sense.\nThe definition of Distinct topsoil itself is not proposed to be changed so that the definitions of other orders remain consistent.\nADD an additional criteria that Gley soils do not contain a diagnostic amount of allophanic soil material (new criteria 1(e))\nRationale soils that fail out on this new criteria belong more correctly in the LG Allophanic Gley group, and new criteria directs them there. Gleys that contain tephric soil material that doesn’t meet the requirements for allophanic soil materials (for example, gley soils forming in poorly drained alluvia from mixed sources but including some reworked ash), may still key out as GT Tephric Gleys.\nADD a statement to the Allophanic Soils definition covering situations where allophanic soil material is shallow over rock.\nRationale Without this statement, shallow allophanic soils over rock are most likely to be pushed into the BL Allophanic Brown or RT Recent Tephric subgroups, neither of which may be the most appropriate destination.\nADD an additional criteria to Melanic soils specifying the expected dominant soil parent materials.\nRationale The Melanic order has been occasionally misinterpreted to apply to a wider variety of profiles with dark topsoils than was originally intended.\nCHANGE criteria 3b of Melanic soils to include some additional possibilities for soils below pH 5.9\nRationale newly available data\n\n\n\nC.0.1.4 Allophanic soils\n\nUpdate the concept, correlation, occurrence and accessory properties sections to reflect contemporary knowledge.\n\n\n\nC.0.1.5 Anthropic soils\n\nADD group AO (Māori Anthropic), containing subgroups AOA (Artefact Māori Anthropic), AOB (Organic Māori Anthropic), and AOF (Fill Māori Anthropic).\nREMOVE subgroup AFA (Artifact Fill Anthropic Soils).\nRationale Māori soils have been previously recognised in the classification at a lower level and with less detail. Adding these groups and subgroups enables clear identification (particularly in mapping) and more effectively distinguishes them from other Anthropic soils.\nADD subgroup ARW (Wet Refuse Anthropic Soils)\nRationale These soils will break down in a different manner to other Refuse Anthropic Soils.\nADD subgroups AMI (Inverted-tephric Mixed Anthropic Soils), AMZ (Inverted-impeded Mixed Anthropic Soils) and AMT (Typic Mixed Anthropic Soils).\nRationale the previous lack of subgroups prevented the classification from being able to represent particular and very distinctive modern land modification practices.\n\n\n\nC.0.1.6 Brown soils\n\nADD subgroup BML (Allophanic Mafic Brown Soils)\nRationale see comments on Melanic soils below\nADD Subgroup BFF (Placic Firm Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BFWA (Acidic-weathered Firm Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BFPA (Acidic-pallic Firm Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BOMP (Mottled-pallic Orthic Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BOWA (Acidic Weathered Orthic Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nREMOVE requirement for no placic horizon in group BS (Sandy Brown Soils)\nRationale requirement was inconsistent with the existence of BSMP (Mottled-placic Sandy Brown Soils) within the group.\nREMOVE subgroup BLAM (Acidic-mafic Allophanic Brown)\nRationale: With the additions made to the Mafic Melanic and Mafic Brown groups, this subgroup has become superfluous. Linking allophanic subgroups directly to mafic groups (EM, BM) will better account for the mechanisms behind the allophanic characteristics in these soils that are likely different to that of soils with allophanic characteristics from tephra and more felsic lithology.\nAMEND Mottled subgroups in the Brown Soils (BLM, BSMP, BSM, BMMG, BMM, BAMP, BAM, BFMA, BFMC, BFMW, BFMP, BFM, BOMA, BOM) to be defined by the presence of a mottled profile form or perch-gley features. This also applies to the new subgroup BOMP.\nRationale: Perch-gley features can induce a profile form that is in part reduced, but not necessarily as strongly as is required for a gley soil. The reduction is often seasonal rather than year-round. These soils are usually considered imperfectly rather than poorly drained. For further discussion, see Hewitt et al. (2021), pp. 76-78.\nMOVE BAX (Pan Acid Brown Soils) up one position in the key.\nRationale this matches the order seen in the Pan Podzols.\n\n\n\nC.0.1.7 Melanic soils\n\nADD subgroups EML (Allophanic Mafic Melanic), EMA (Acidic Mafic Melanic).\nRationale Acidification, high P retention and presence of allophanic material in Melanic soils from mafic rock types (e.g., basalt) as observed under higher precipitation (&gt;800-1000 mm) does not necessarily lead to the loss of the typical characteristics of Melanic soils, such as the dominance of mafic parent material, dark-coloured Fe/Mg/Ti-rich minerals, smectitic clays, a well-developed pedality and higher organic carbon contents. Despite their lower soil pH and exchangeable bases, they are more closely related to soils in the existing EM group than they are to their former groups (BL, BM) in the Brown Soil order.\n\n\n\nC.0.1.8 Raw soils\n\nADD group WW (Hydric Raw Soils)\nRationale These soils are usually under shallow water (e.g. lower tidal areas, lake shores).\nADD subgroups WST (Tephric Sandy Raw Soils) and WSS (Typic Sandy Raw Soils).\nRationale new soil observations\n\n\n\nC.0.1.9 Recent soils\n\nADD subgroups RXMA (Mottled-acidic Rocky Recent Soils) and RXM (Mottled Rocky Recent Soils).\nRationale new soil observations\n\n\n\n\nC.0.2 Minor\n\nC.0.2.1 Introduction\n\nUPDATE subsection ‘Objectives’ to include a reference to the Methods and Rationale\nUPDATE Figure 1.2 (new nodular subgroup)\nADD Table 1.1 summarising estimated occurrence of Soil Taxonomy orders in New Zealand\n\n\n\nC.0.2.2 Correlations\n\nDiscussions of correlations between the NZSC and other systems have been updated to reflect changes to both them and the NZSC.\n\n\n\nC.0.2.3 Terminology\n\nAMEND the definition of Cutanoxidic horizon to put all requirements in the numbered criteria list.\nAMEND the definition of Densipan to put all requirements in the numbered criteria list.\nAMEND the definition of Duripan to include a horizon notation example.\nAMEND the definition of Ironstone-pan to include a horizon notation example.\nAMEND the definition of Tephric soil materials to simpify the terminology list.\nAMEND the definition of Truncated Anthropic soils for clarity.\nAMEND the definition of Mixed Anthropic soils for clarity.\nAMEND the definition of Refuse Anthropic soils to specifically include plastics in ‘manufactured organic material’ and remove the requirement to attempt ignition of suspected methane.\nAMEND the definition of Firm Brown Soils to be more specific about the strength requirements.\nAMEND subgroup ZPOZ (Peaty-silt-mantled Perch-gley Podzols); in requirement 1(b), ‘pedality’ was used where ‘structure’ should have been.\nAMEND group ZX (Pan Podzols) to be more specific about the strength requirements.\nAMEND group ZO (Orthic Podzols) to be more specific about excluded horizons.\nAMEND the definition of MOI (Immature OrthicPumiceSoils) to correct colour requirements.\nRECODE AFE (Earthy Fill Anthropic Soils) to AFT (Typic Fill Anthropic Soils).\nRECODE BFAC (Acidic-cemented Firm Brown Soils) to BFCA.\nRECODE BFAL (Acidic-allophanic Firm Brown Soils) to BFLA.\nRECODE PXJM (Argillic-mottled Fragic Pallic Soils) to PXMJ.\nRENAME BAMP (Mottled-placic Acid Brown Soils) to BAMP (Mottled-impeded Acid Brown Soils).\nREPLACE use of the term ‘calcium/magnesium ratio’ with ‘calcium/magnesium molar ratio’\nREPLACE various terms for in-profile stone &gt; 2 mm (e.g. clasts, gravel) with ‘rock fragments’.\nREPLACE use of the term ‘acid’ with ‘acidic’ when used as a descriptor.\nREPLACE references to E horizons with cross-references to the new eluvial horizon diagnostic.\nREPLACE references to salinity cutoffs with cross-references to the new Saline soil materials diagnostic.\nREMOVE the phrase ‘(or some subhorizon of the B)’ from the definition of the Podzolic-B horizon (superfluous).\nREMOVE redundant reference to depth requirements in part 2 of the LOA (Acidic Orthic Allophanic) soil definition.\n\n\n\nC.0.2.4 Consistency\n\nREMOVE reference to ‘stony brown’ soil group in the Brown soils accessory properties list, point 8. This concept was retired between v2.0 and v3.0.\nAMEND all units to SI standards (e.g. CEC in cmolc/kg)\nRefer consistently to ‘B or BC’ horizons where appropriate.\nNumbered major headings\nConsistent formatting for criteria lists\n\n\n\nC.0.2.5 References\n\nReferences have been updated where new editions or versions of certain documents have become available.
