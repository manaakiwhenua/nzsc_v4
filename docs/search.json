    "text": "Objectives\nVersion 4.0 of the Zealand Soil Classification is the culmination of a period of development from its initiation in 1983 to wide circulation of versions 1.0 through to 3.0 (Hewitt 1989; Hewitt 2010) for comment and testing. It represents the best attempt, given the current state of knowledge, to classify New Zealand soils. As the knowledge and understanding of New Zealand soils grows, further revisions will be necessary.\nThe New Zealand Soil Classification is a national soil classification intended to replace the New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification (Taylor 1948; Taylor and Cox 1957; Taylor and Pohlen 1962). The New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification grew out of the need for reconnaissance mapping of the nation’s soil resources. It was successful as a unifying factor in New Zealand soil science, and it played a vital role in the development of pastoral agriculture. However, modern soil surveys and land evaluations required precise definition of classes and keys for their recognition. Furthermore, a new synthesis was needed of the large body of information collected since the 1950s. The present work has grown out of the New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification and, where possible, preserves successful parts of that classification. It has also been influenced by experience in testing the US Soil Taxonomy (Leamy et al. 1983).\nThe objectives of the New Zealand Soil Classification are:\nA discussion of these objectives is given by Hewitt (1984).",

    "text": "Principles\nTo accomplish the objectives, the following principles have guided the development of this proposal. These are explained further by Hewitt (1984).\n\nThe classification should be hierarchical, providing ascending levels of generalisation.\nThe grouping of soils into classes should be based on similarity of measurable soil properties rather than presumed genesis.\nClasses must be designed to allow the greatest number and most precise accessory statements to be made about them consistent with their level in the hierarchy.\nDifferentia should be based on soil properties that can be reproducibly and precisely measured or observed.\nDifferentia should where possible allow field assignment of soils to classes, either directly, or by tested inferences.\nThe nomenclature of higher categories should be based where possible on connotative English words chosen for their acceptability to nonspecialists.\nWhere possible, continuity with successful parts of the New Zealand Genetic Classification should be maintained.\nThe soil classification must be valid for the main islands of New Zealand. Classes must be correlated with Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) to support international extension.",

    "section": "The Soil Individual",
    "text": "The Soil Individual\nThe soil individual is the fundamental unit of soil which is assigned to classes. Cline (1949) defined an individual as “the smallest natural body that can be defined as a thing complete in itself”.\nSoil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) regards the polypedon as the soil individual. This is rejected here because, as discussed by Hewitt (1982), it does not fulfil Cline’s (1949) or Johnson’s (1963) requirements for a soil individual.\nIn New Zealand, the soil individual has traditionally been the soil profile. Usually conceived as a two-dimensional section exposed by a soil pit, it is in fact a three-dimensional slice sufficiently thick to sample and examine hand specimens. It should therefore be termed a “soil profile slice”. With the realisation that soils should be examined in successive horizontal sections as well as the vertical profile, there is increasing acceptance that a volume of soil the size of the pedon Soil Survey Staff (1999) represents a better soil individual than the soil profile slice.\nAccordingly, the pedon as defined in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) is recommended as the soil individual for the New Zealand Soil Classification. It is understood that assignments are often made from the examination of volumes of soil smaller than a complete pedon, where they are assumed representative of the pedon.",

    "text": "How to assign a soil to Subgroup level\nNormally, a soil pit must be dug of sufficient size to expose the soil horizons to about 1 m depth, or to rock if shallower.\nThe soil horizons are examined and the assignment is then made by following the key, starting with the Key to Orders. The “Diagnostic Horizons and Other Differentiae” section is consulted as necessary to identify diagnostic horizons and other differentia. For some classes, pH or other chemical measurements must be made. These should be performed on samples taken between the specified depths, and bulked from at least four places in the pit. The characteristics of the soil are compared with the key statements of each soil order, starting with Anthropic Soils and passing down the key to the first soil order that fits them. When a soil order is identified, the chapter concerning that order is consulted and the keys to soil groups and soil subgroups are followed in the same manner to identify the appropriate soil group and subgroup.\nThe name given to a soil assigned to a subgroup is made up of three elements in the sequence: subgroup, group, and order (for example, Nodular Perch-gley Oxidic Soils). Figure 2.1 illustrates the relationships between subgroups and groups in the Oxidic Soils order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The hierarchy of the Oxidic Soils as an example of the hierarchical relationships between orders, groups and subgroups. As the diagram suggests, the range of soil properties for each class is related to hierarchical position.",

The key is merely a means of allocating soils to these classes, and by its nature is imperfect because only a sample of all the possible soils that might potentially be allocated were used in developing the key. Consequently, soils will be found that are not allocated to the appropriate class by the key. This will be apparent when a soil, allocated to a class, does not conform to the concept and accessory statements that can normally be made about that class. Because the key is the servant of the classes, the allocator is justified in placing the soil misfit into a more appropriate class. If this is done, however, it must be registered with the person with responsibility for the national soil classification system, so that appropriate adjustments may be made to the key when the soil classification is next revised. An allocation contrary to the key must also be noted in any records or publication of the allocation.",

Second, an existing subgroup may encompass a set of soils with properties that are too wide in range. The old subgroup could be split into two new ones. Splitting may be justified if it will significantly increase the number and precision of accessory statements that can be made about both of the new classes.",

    "text": "Major\n\nDiagnostics\n\nADD clear definitions of the phrases ‘in some part’ and ‘in the major part’ to the top of the chapter.\nRationale these were previously sitting in footnotes within the Allophanic and Brown chapters, making them hard to find.\nADD Anthropic Soil Material as a diagnostic for the Anthropic order.\nRationale: Anthropic materials were not previously defined, causing confusion during the classification process.\nADD Eluvial horizon as a diagnostic for Pallic and some Brown soils.\nRationale: Concepts appearing in the key require a clear diagnostic definition within the classification, independant of the description manual, which was previously implicitly linked.\nADD Saline Soil Material as a diagnostic.\nRationale: Elevated soil salinity defines subgroups in the Gley, Semi-Arid, Recent and Raw orders but the concept has not been fully explained.\nAMEND Calcareous horizon for clarity and brevity, adding a clearer definition of primary vs secondary carbonates and including example horizon notation. Removed extraneous second paragraph.\nRationale: Removal of the second paragraph is justified on the grounds that the content is better suited to the Methods and Rationale of the NZSC (Hewitt 1993).\nAMEND Densipan to include expected horizon notation, and remove reference to specific types of field testing.\nRationale: Strength and penetration resistance testing should be undertaken using current best practices, which do not need to be specified in this document.\nAMEND Fragipan to include expected horizon notation, and remove reference to specific types of field testing. Additionally, clarify that bulk density is expected to be greater than or equal to 1.5 Mg/m3.\nAMEND the table in Reactive Aluminium test to match the new Soil Description Manual draft and demonstrate more realistic reaction colours.\n\n\n\nKey\n\nMOVE Anthropic soils to the top of the key.\nRationale: Removing Anthropic Soils from contention first can reduce confusion when applying the rest of the key, and keeps the overall classification structure relatively simple. The Australian Soil Classification with its Anthroposol order and the Japanese Soil Classification with its Developed/Reclaimed soils (造成土大群) make a similar choice. The World Reference base is effectively the same - it places its two equivalent orders (Anthrosols and Technosols, for agricultural and urban/industrial situations respectively) in second and third place after the Histosols. This reflects the rapidity with which organic soil materials can accumulate on the land surface. The Histosol definition itself allows for the presence of anthropic features like artefacts, so all human-modified profiles are effectively classified out early in the WRB key.\nBy contrast, US Soil Taxonomy uses the Anthric and Plaggic Epipedon concepts to modify other orders. This has the advantage of keeping human-influenced soils conceptually close to their more natural neighbours, but adds a large number of subgroups to the classification, making it potentially more difficult to use. These subgroups will continue to proliferate as humans discover new and interesting ways to modify their environment. Other systems either ignore human-modified profiles or deliberately exclude them from consideration, neither of which practice is considered useful.\nCHANGE the criteria for Recent Soils to allow soils that do not fully meet the criteria for a Distinct Topsoil by only having a ‘structural A’ horizon.\nRationale: This change helps to account for soils that have only a slight colour difference (e.g. visually perceptible darkening but still within the same Munsell chip, or only a Hue shift) in the A horizon due to tillage, low natural organic carbon content, or similar, but are still clearly too developed and in the wrong landscapes for the Raw order to make sense.\nThe definition of Distinct topsoil itself is not proposed to be changed so that the definitions of other orders remain consistent.\nADD an additional criteria that Gley soils do not contain a diagnostic amount of allophanic soil material (new criteria 1(e))\nRationale soils that fail out on this new criteria belong more correctly in the LG Allophanic Gley group, and new criteria directs them there. Gleys that contain tephric soil material that doesn’t meet the requirements for allophanic soil materials (for example, gley soils forming in poorly drained alluvia from mixed sources but including some reworked ash), may still key out as GT Tephric Gleys.\nADD a statement to the Allophanic Soils definition covering situations where allophanic soil material is shallow over rock.\nRationale Without this statement, shallow allophanic soils over rock are most likely to be pushed into the BL Allophanic Brown or RT Recent Tephric subgroups, neither of which may be the most appropriate destination.\nADD an additional criteria to Melanic soils specifying the expected dominant soil parent materials.\nRationale The Melanic order has been occasionally misinterpreted to apply to a wider variety of profiles with dark topsoils than was originally intended.\nCHANGE criteria 3b of Melanic soils to include some additional possibilities for soils below pH 5.9\nRationale newly available data\n\n\n\nAnthropic soils\n\nADD group AO (Māori Anthropic), containing subgroups AOA (Artefact Māori Anthropic), AOB (Organic Māori Anthropic), and AOF (Fill Māori Anthropic).\nREMOVE subgroup AFA (Artifact Fill Anthropic Soils).\nRationale Māori soils have been previously recognised in the classification at a lower level and with less detail. Adding these groups and subgroups enables clear identification (particularly in mapping) and more effectively distinguishes them from other Anthropic soils.\nADD subgroup ARW (Wet Refuse Anthropic Soils)\nRationale These soils will break down in a different manner to other Refuse Anthropic Soils.\nADD subgroups AMI (Inverted-tephric Mixed Anthropic Soils), AMZ (Inverted-impeded Mixed Anthropic Soils) and AMT (Typic Mixed Anthropic Soils).\nRationale the previous lack of subgroups prevented the classification from being able to represent particular and very distinctive modern land modification practices.\n\n\n\nBrown soils\n\nADD subgroup BML (Allophanic Mafic Brown Soils)\nRationale see comments on Melanic soils below\nADD Subgroup BFF (Placic Firm Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BFWA (Acidic-weathered Firm Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BFPA (Acidic-pallic Firm Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BOMP (Mottled-pallic Orthic Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nADD Subgroup BOWA (Acidic Weathered Orthic Brown Soils)\nRationale new soil observations\nREMOVE requirement for no placic horizon in group BS (Sandy Brown Soils)\nRationale requirement was inconsistent with the existence of BSMP (Mottled-placic Sandy Brown Soils) within the group.\nREMOVE subgroup BLAM (Acidic-mafic Allophanic Brown)\nRationale: With the additions made to the Mafic Melanic and Mafic Brown groups, this subgroup has become superfluous. Linking allophanic subgroups directly to mafic groups (EM, BM) will better account for the mechanisms behind the allophanic characteristics in these soils that are likely different to that of soils with allophanic characteristics from tephra and more felsic lithology.\nAMEND Mottled subgroups in the Brown Soils (BLM, BSMP, BSM, BMMG, BMM, BAMP, BAM, BFMA, BFMC, BFMW, BFMP, BFM, BOMA, BOM) to be defined by the presence of a mottled profile form or perch-gley features. This also applies to the new subgroup BOMP.\nRationale: Perch-gley features can induce a profile form that is in part reduced, but not necessarily as strongly as is required for a gley soil. The reduction is often seasonal rather than year-round. These soils are usually considered imperfectly rather than poorly drained. For further discussion, see Hewitt et al. (2021), pp. 76-78.\nMOVE BAX (Pan Acid Brown Soils) up one position in the key.\nRationale this matches the order seen in the Pan Podzols.\n\n\n\nMelanic soils\n\nADD subgroups EML (Allophanic Mafic Melanic), EMA (Acidic Mafic Melanic).\nRationale Acidification, high P retention and presence of allophanic material in Melanic soils from mafic rock types (e.g., basalt) as observed under higher precipitation (&gt;800-1000 mm) does not necessarily lead to the loss of the typical characteristics of Melanic soils, such as the dominance of mafic parent material, dark-coloured Fe/Mg/Ti-rich minerals, smectitic clays, a well-developed pedality and higher organic carbon contents. Despite their lower soil pH and exchangeable bases, they are more closely related to soils in the existing EM group than they are to their former groups (BL, BM) in the Brown Soil order.\n\n\n\nRaw soils\n\nADD group WW (Hydric Raw Soils)\nRationale These soils are usually under shallow water (e.g. lower tidal areas, lake shores).\nADD subgroups WST (Tephric Sandy Raw Soils) and WSS (Typic Sandy Raw Soils).\nRationale new soil observations\n\n\n\nRecent soils\n\nADD subgroups RXMA (Mottled-acidic Rocky Recent Soils) and RXM (Mottled Rocky Recent Soils).\nRationale new soil observations\n\n\n\n\nMinor\n\nCorrelations\n\nDiscussions of correlations between the NZSC and other systems have been updated to reflect changes to both them and the NZSC.\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\nAMEND the definition of Cutanoxidic horizon to put all requirements in the numbered criteria list.\nAMEND the definition of Densipan to put all requirements in the numbered criteria list.\nAMEND the definition of Duripan to include a horizon notation example.\nAMEND the definition of Ironstone-pan to include a horizon notation example.\nAMEND the definition of Tephric soil materials to simpify the terminology list.\nAMEND the definition of Truncated Anthropic soils for clarity.\nAMEND the definition of Mixed Anthropic soils for clarity.\nAMEND the definition of Refuse Anthropic soils to specifically include plastics in ‘manufactured organic material’ and remove the requirement to attempt ignition of suspected methane.\nAMEND the definition of Firm Brown Soils to be more specific about the strength requirements.\nAMEND subgroup ZPOZ (Peaty-silt-mantled Perch-gley Podzols); in requirement 1(b), ‘pedality’ was used where ‘structure’ should have been.\nAMEND group ZX (Pan Podzols) to be more specific about the strength requirements.\nAMEND group ZO (Orthic Podzols) to be more specific about excluded horizons.\nAMEND the definition of MOI (Immature OrthicPumiceSoils) to correct colour requirements.\nRECODE AFE (Earthy Fill Anthropic Soils) to AFT (Typic Fill Anthropic Soils).\nRECODE BFAC (Acidic-cemented Firm Brown Soils) to BFCA.\nRECODE BFAL (Acidic-allophanic Firm Brown Soils) to BFLA.\nRECODE PXJM (Argillic-mottled Fragic Pallic Soils) to PXMJ.\nRENAME BAMP (Mottled-placic Acid Brown Soils) to BAMP (Mottled-impeded Acid Brown Soils).\nREPLACE use of the term ‘calcium/magnesium ratio’ with ‘calcium/magnesium molar ratio’\nREPLACE various terms for in-profile stone &gt; 2 mm (e.g. clasts, gravel) with ‘rock fragments’.\nREPLACE use of the term ‘acid’ with ‘acidic’ when used as a descriptor.\nREPLACE references to E horizons with cross-references to the new eluvial horizon diagnostic.\nREPLACE references to salinity cutoffs with cross-references to the new Saline soil materials diagnostic.\nREMOVE the phrase ‘(or some subhorizon of the B)’ from the definition of the Podzolic-B horizon (superfluous).\nREMOVE redundant reference to depth requirements in part 2 of the LOA (Acidic Orthic Allophanic) soil definition.\n\n\n\nConsistency\n\nREMOVE reference to ‘stony brown’ soil group in the Brown soils accessory properties list, point 8.

Other terms such as “amorphous”, “poorly crystalline” and “non-crystalline”, have been, or are, sometimes used for such minerals. Their chief characteristics are reactive variable-charge surfaces, and a very high specific surface area (several hundreds of m2/g).\nAllophanic soil material has BOTH\nLayers meeting the requirements of allophanic soil material may also meet the requirements of vitric soil material.\nAccessory chemical properties relate to variable-charge characteristics, P retention, and high organic-matter contents. Accessory physical properties include high total available water capacity and readily available water capacity, and low penetration resistance. In addition, allophanic soil material undergoes irreversible changes upon drying, for example, in plastic and liquid limits and in apparent particle-size distribution. It should be noted that minerals other than allophane (e.g. ferrihydrite) can give rise to allophanic soil material.",

    "section": "Anthropic Soil Material",
    "text": "Anthropic Soil Material\nAnthropic material constitutes human-altered or human-transported soil material that shows evidence of the purposeful modification of soil properties or of earth-surface features by human activity. The field evidence of alteration excludes low impact agricultural practices such as shallow cultivation, digging, ploughing, or the addition of amendments. Artifically drained wetlands are also not included here because it is difficult to unambiguously link artificial drainage to specific, field-identifieable soil indicators. The nature of alteration can comprise profile truncation, mixing, deposition of transported material, and addition of artefacts. Due to the high variability of the morphological or chemical soil properties that can result from human soil modifications, the criteria of Anthropic material are mainly linked to their anthropic genesis, and thus deviate from the principles of the NZSC. Common indicators of Anthropic material in New Zealand are:\n\nexcavated or constructed landforms,\nmechanically detached, redistributed, and re-oriented soil material,\nmechanically abraded and broken rock fragments that do not correspond with the fragments in the underlying soil material (e.g., fractures that cut through rather than between individual minerals),\nmanufactured materials, such as charcoal, and artefacts,\nrelocated soil material overlying bones, shells or manufactured materials,\neating and cooking waste and associated charred products,\nwaste products of manufacturing processes, including chemical contaminants.\n\nThe relationship between natural soil horizons or parent materials with Anthropic material or truncation is commonly in the form of a lithological discontinuity, indicated by distinct to sharp transitions between horizons. The majority of Anthropic material (including truncation) in NZ is the result of distinct and extensive modification from the mid-19th century coinciding with early European settlement, deforestation, and farming. From the mid-20th century, excavation and construction (e.g., infrastructure, roading, industrial and urban expansion) has increasingly intensified these impacts on our soils. The influence of ‘older’ Māori cultural practice (e.g., soil alteration/modification practices, Māori plaggen soils) is still recognised in many parts of NZ, and can predate European settlement. Distinct soil management alterations from historical (dating back to early Polynesian settlement) to modern can be distinguished at the group or family level. Anthropic material is indicated on a per-horizon basis by the Parent Material Class notation ‘An’. This notation can be appended with ‘m’, ‘e’, or ‘n’ to distinguish pre-modern Māori modifications, pre-modern European modifications, and modern modifications, if desired (e.g ‘An-m’).",

It is likely that the iron has been precipitated from iron-rich groundwater moving laterally. In Taranaki (Childs et al. 1990), the pans are porous and some appear to have formed as iron-oxide rhizomorphs, which have been progressively infilled and welded together by further precipitations of iron oxide. In these pans the mineralogy is dominated by varying proportions of goethite and ferrihydrite.\nIronstone-pans are not usually associated with eluvial horizons and do not occur in Podzols. They differ from ortstein-pans and placic horizons which are often associated with eluvial horizons in Podzols or Brown Soils, and which have high organic carbon levels. Ironstone pans meet the requirements of the material below a petroferric contact of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999).\nThe pans are a barrier to plant roots. Heavy machinery is required to break them up for the installation of drains. The permeability of the pans is likely to be slow.",

These can severely affect plant growth and land use, and increase soil erosion (Hazelton and Murphy 2016, p. 95).\nMost soils generate some salt as a product of chemical weathering, with composition and concentration determined by the parent material lithology. Soils may also receive additional salt at their surface, transported by wind and/or rain. Some soils are affected by saline groundwater from marine or hydrothermal sources.\nUnder higher rainfall regimes and under good drainage conditions, these salts are leached from the soil (Hewitt et al. 2021). Where rainfall is too low to remove salt (or a profile is in a low-lying, water-receiving location), salts can accumulate and may ultimately precipitate as crystals in the profile and/or on the soil surface.\nSoil salinity is somewhat difficult to measure in the field in ways that can be strongly related to plant growth (DERM 2011). As a compromise, the electrical conductivity (EC) of a 1:5 solution of soil to deionised water is measured. Results exceeding 0.8 mS/cm within in the top 60 cm of the soil profile are considered significant enough to be considered in the classification of Gley, Recent and Semi-Arid soil orders. Exceedences within 30 cm of the surface are recognised in the classification of Raw soils.\nNote that salinity at any given location (including within the profile) is expected to be highly variable across seasons, and will generally be at its maximum towards the end of a dry summer.",

    "text": "Accessory Properties of the Order\n\nShort-range-order minerals. The soil matrix as well as pore surfaces are dominated by the clay minerals allophane, imogolite and ferrihydrite, and/or aluminium-humus complexes. The soil materials have very high specific surface area. Measured clay contents generally range from 10 to 25% though particle-size measurement is difficult because of aggregation and the “true” or primary clay contents may often be considerably higher. P retention is high or very high.\nLow bases. Sum of bases are low to very low and range from less than 1 to 10 cmolc/100 g in subsoils and unfertilised topsoils.\nVolcanic or greywacke parent materials. Predominantly in andesitic, rhyolitic or mixed tephra, they also occur in soil materials from sandstone (greywacke) of humid uplands and high country and basalt scoria or pumice.\nRapid mineral weathering. Volcanic glass and feldspar dominate the sand fractions of soils in igneous parent materials, and are the primary source of the short-range-order minerals. Feldspars are most likely the primary source in non-igneous parent materials. Typically they have an Amorphic mineralogy class.\nRapid permeability and high water retention. The macroporosity is very high and rapid drainage occurs at low soil moisture tensions. Water contents at 1500 kPa soil moisture tension are very high.\nWell drained. Although poorly, imperfectly and moderately well drained soils occur, well drained soils are predominant.\nGood rooting medium. Bulk density is very low and there is little resistance to root extension. In many soils the potential rooting depth is very deep.\nActive soil fauna. Microbial biomass is generally high.\nStable topsoils. Soils resist puddling under the impact of machinery or grazing animals in wet weather. The water content at field capacity is less than the plastic limit. Topsoil and subsoil horizons are friable, and organic/mineral complexes are stable. Carbon contents are medium to high. Exposed topsoil may be subject to wind erosion.\nHigh shrinkage potential. Soil materials have high potential to shrink on drying. Rewetting may not achieve the original volume.\nSlight to insignificant erosion under pasture. Generally the erosion potential is low, except on steep slopes or exposed sites and under cultivation on rolling slopes.\nSensitive. A pronounced loss of strength occurs on disturbance.\nLimited fertility. There are usually requirements for phosphorus, potassium and magnesium on dairy farms. There are no significant trace element deficiencies although cobalt is marginal in more strongly leached Allophanic Soils. Pasture may respond to lime where pH is less than 5.3. Sulphate reserves are held in B horizons. P retention and phosphate fixation are high in topsoils.\nMoist climate. Precipitation exceeds 1000 mm and soil moisture deficits are either absent or occur for only short periods.",

Redox segregations of iron and manganese oxides, however, are usually present elsewhere in the soil and may occupy large volumes.\nCommonly formed in alluvial or colluvial parent materials. Soils most frequently occur in relatively low parts of the landscape, in hollows or associated with rushes.\nWide range of clay minerals. The clay mineralogy commonly reflects the mineralogy of the ungleyed material from which the soils are derived. Gley Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes with Mixed, Illitic, and Smectitic being the most common.\nPoorly or very poorly drained. Topsoils have relatively high levels of organic matter and some are peaty. Subsurface horizons to depth are dominantly grey or bluish grey in colour with strong brown to dark brown redox segregations.\nHigh groundwater-tables. Most are affected by high groundwater-tables, at least throughout winter months. Soils with slowly permeable layers may also be subject to perching.\nShallow potential rooting depth. Potential rooting depth is limited by poor aeration. Even after drainage, root extension may be limited in some horizons.\nRelatively high bulk densities. Bulk densities are likely to be higher than in well drained soils in similar soil materials.\nLimited trafficability. Trafficability is limited in most soils when wet and pugging damage by stock is likely.\nResponse to drainage. Crops, not adapted to wetness, respond well to drainage.\nMinimal erosion. Flooding or ponding of water is likely on low-lying sites, especially on floodplains. Deposition of fresh sediment is possible in these sites.\nNitrogen requirement. Nitrogen requirements are likely to be higher than for associated well drained soils.",

The soil fabric comprises polyhedral peds with strength characteristics which change rapidly with water content. Consistence is sticky and plastic. The presence of vermiculite gives these soils a moderate buffering capacity.

Too few data are yet available to allow mineralogy classes to be stated.\nHigh cation exchange capacity. The organic components of Organic Soils have high surface area, and high negative charge that varies markedly with pH. CEC values are very high, mostly ranging from 40 to 170 cmolc/kg.\nHigh carbon/nitrogen ratios. C/N ratios range from 18 to as high as 70 in unfertilised and uncultivated Organic Soils.\nLow bearing strength. Construction of buildings or roads requires special foundation design.\nVery low thermal conductivity. Soils warm and cool slowly. Bare soil surfaces, however, have high radiance.\nHigh shrinkage potential. The soils shrink markedly upon drying, and lose organic matter due to oxidation. Consequently, following drainage, the classification may change.\nHigh total available water capacity. While total available water capacity is high, plant-available water capacity may only be moderate due to limits in rooting depth (anoxic conditions, species-specific limitations).\nCommon nutrient deficiencies. The major nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur, and the trace elements copper, selenium and molybdenum, are frequently deficient for crops and pasture.\nPeats are very poorly drained, litters are variable. Organic Soils formed in peats are very poorly drained and those formed from litters may range from well drained to very poorly drained.",

Some subhorizons have a net positive charge. Oxidic Soils usually have the following mineralogy classes: Kandic, Ferritic or Aluminitic.\nHigh phosphate retention. P-retention ranges from 60 to 90%. High sulphate adsorption occurs in B horizons.\nParent materials. The soils are derived from andesites, dolerites and basalts of mid-Pleistocene and older ages.\nLimited root depth. The extension of plant roots is limited by high dry bulk density and high penetration resistance, particularly in well drained soils. Plant root depths are shallow to medium.\nModerate or rapid infiltration. Hydraulic conductivity of surface horizons and upper B horizons is moderate or faster, giving excellent trafficability and workability immediately after rain.\nSlow permeability. Hydraulic conductivity decreases to slow or marginally slow values with depth, such that perching of water occurs within the root zone after high intensity rainfalls. The duration of wetness varies from 1 to 2 days in well drained soils to 4 days or more in poorly drained soils.\nSoil water deficit. Deficits occur in summer and are exacerbated by low readily available water capacities and shallow rooting depths.\nHigh clay contents. Clay content ranges from 50 to 90%.\nWell-developed structure.

Base saturation values in subsoils are high (more than 50%) except in perch-gleyed soils, where values may be lower in horizons overlying fragipans.\nSiliceous parent materials. Parent materials are predominantly loess or sediments derived from quartzo-feldspathic rocks (schist or greywacke).\nMica/illite clay minerals. Pallic Soils usually belong either to the Illitic or to a Clay-mineralic mineralogy class.\nSlow permeability. Subsurface horizons have restricted permeability, particularly in soils with fragipans or duripans in which the permeability is very slow.\nPerched water-tables. Soils that are poorly or moderately well drained have water-tables perched on slowly permeable layers.\nLimited root depth. Potential rooting depth in most soils is limited by a subsurface horizon of high bulk density at shallow depths or by brittle silty cappings on rock fragments.\nStrongly worm-mixed. Topsoils generally have a significant proportion of worm casts and a distinct worm-mixed horizon occurs in the transition from A to B horizons. Topsoil worm activity is greatly reduced during summer periods of soil moisture deficit.\nHigh slaking and dispersion potential. Soil material, particularly in B horizons, is strongly dispersive and will readily slake. Topsoil structures may break down under prolonged impact by heavy machinery or by continuous tillage.\nDroughty summers, moist winters. Precipitation ranges from about 500 to 1000 mm per year. A spring surplus of soil water is common but the annual surplus is less than about 200 mm. The average annual deficit is approximately 90–200 mm/year.\nPhosphorus status.

In B horizons they are coated, and in some soils cemented, by short-range-order minerals and/or organic matter.\nLow base saturation. Base saturations are very low and the soils are extremely acid in A and E horizons. KCl-extractable-aluminium levels are high, and aluminium in soil solution may be toxic to some plants.\nParent materials. The soils are derived predominantly from felsic rocks such as granite, greywacke, schist or rhyolite.\nMineralogically differentiated. Mica-smectite or smectite often occur in A and E horizons, and hydroxy-coated or interlayered minerals or allophane often occur in the B horizon. In some Northland soils, silica is dominant in B horizons. Podzols cover a wide range of mineralogy classes.\nLimited rooting depth. The rooting depth is limited for many introduced plants by low pH or aluminium toxicity, or by pans which often cause problems of wetness.\nLow biological activity. Low levels of faunal activity occur with a low rate of mineralisation. Carbon/nitrogen ratios are very high. The accumulation of weakly decomposed humus and minimal incorporation of humus into the upper mineral soil results in a mor-like humus form.\nMor-forming vegetation. The soils have been associated with vegetation producing an acid litter of low nutrient content.\nInfertile. The soils have very low natural fertility with high nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime requirements.\nWet climate. The soils occur mainly in areas with a precipitation of 1400 mm or more and unless sandy, are likely to have a soil water surplus for a considerable part of the year.",

P retention levels are also very low (usually less than 15%).\nHigh base status. Base saturation values in subsoils are high and rise to 100% at the base of the solum.\nParent materials. The soils occur in materials from non-calcareous quartzo-feldspathic schist and indurated sandstone (greywacke).\nIllitic clay mineralogy. Mica/illite clay minerals predominate with trace primary chlorite and kaolinite. Semiarid Soils almost always have an Illitic mineralogy class unless they have a clay content of less than 10% and fall into the Mixed class.\nPermeability. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow in soils with argillic or cutanic horizons, and in some other silty or fine sandy soils. Infiltration may be reduced by pugging.\nDrainage. No poorly or very poorly drained soils are included.\nAvailable water capacity. Available water capacity is limited in most subsoils.\nLow biological activity. In the natural state, biological activity is limited by droughtiness.\nHigh slaking and dispersion potential. Soil materials are strongly dispersive and will readily slake.\nErosive. The soils are susceptible to wind and water erosion.\nWeakly buffered. The soils are weakly buffered because of low CEC and anion adsorption capacity. They are consequently very sensitive to management, showing rapid changes in response to fertilisation, irrigation and cultivation.\nSoluble salts. Soluble salts are present in many soils and land management must consider the risk of salinisation.\nHigh sodium. Particularly in soils with argillic horizons, sodium occupies a large proportion of the cation exchange complex.\nClimate. Precipitation ranges from about 350 to 500 mm per year, with zero water surplus and a spring soil moisture deficit.",

KCl-extractable aluminium levels of more than 1 cmolc/kg are usual in B horizons, and indicate toxic aluminium which may inhibit root function and may contribute to shallow rooting habits in aluminium-sensitive plants.\nClayey subsoils. CEC values are medium to high. Ultic Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes, Kandic and Smectitic being the most common.\nLow magnesium and potassium. Low concentrations of reserve magnesium and potassium resulting from strong weathering.\nStrongly weathered with low nutrient reserves. Low levels of 0.5M H2SO4- extractable phosphorus (usually less than 3 mg/100 g) and total phosphorus (usually less than 20 mg/100 g) are characteristic. The former reflects low solubility and/or a low level of inorganic phosphorus reserves. Phosphorus supply from inorganic sources under zero phosphorus input grassland farming is negligible after about 2 years. Strong weathering is indicated by low ratio of 0.5M H2SO4--extractable phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus, usually 0.25 or less.\nSlow permeability. A slowly permeable layer occurs in clayey profiles. The majority of soils are imperfectly to poorly drained, few are well-drained. Soil water movement is mainly along planar voids.\nSusceptibility to livestock treading damage. Clayey or low strength silty surface horizons are susceptible to treading damage or compaction during wet periods.\nDispersible surface horizons. Surface horizons, especially silty ones, are dispersible according to the test of McQueen (1981), and are prone to erosion where the surface cover has been removed. Although P retention is usually moderate or high in B horizons, it may be low in A and E horizons consistent with low contents of secondary iron oxides.",

The Allophanic Soils and Pumice Soils proposals are adapted from the ICOMAND proposal (Parfitt and Clayden 1991) and Roger Parfitt’s assistance with these, and other orders, has been appreciated. There are many others who have willingly supplied information, discussed concepts and helped define classes. In particular I thank Trevor Webb, Robin Palmer, Brian Purdie, Hugh Wilde, Iain Campbell, Geoff Mew, Mike Laffan, Peter McIntosh, Alan Palmer, Jim Pollok, David Lowe, Megan Balks, Bob Allbrook, Malcolm McLeod, Gary Orbell and Peter Singleton. Cyril Childs’ editorial help was also much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\nParfitt RL, Clayden B 1991. Andisols  the development of a new order in Soil Taxonomy.
