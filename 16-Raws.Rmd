# Raw Soils

## Concept of the Order

Raw Soils lack distinct topsoil development or are fluid at a shallow depth. They occur in environments where the development of topsoils is prevented by rockiness, by active erosion, or deposition. They include beach sands, alpine rock areas and active screes, lagoons and tidal estuaries.

## Correlation

Raw Soils correspond in part with very weakly developed recent soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification, and in part with materials that were often not considered to be soil. They are either Entisols or are unclassified in Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence

Raw Soils occur scattered throughout New Zealand, particularly in association with high mountains, braided rivers, beaches and tidal mudflats.

## Accessory Properties of the Order

  1.  _No B horizons._ Pedogenetic horizons are lacking apart from a rudimentary topsoil.
  2.  _Fresh or weakly weathered._ Coarse fragments and sand particles are generally without coatings, although clasts in some screes may have weathering rinds.
  3.  _Inherited mineralogy._ The soil mineralogy is very similar to that of the parent material and a range of mineralogy classes is possible.
  4.  _In soils with a fluid subsurface layer, a continuously high water-table is present._ The deposition of fresh sediment may occur.
  5.  _Non-fluid soils occur in environments with active erosion or deposition._
  6.  _Low fertility._ Nitrogen in particular, is deficient.
  7.  _Erosive._ Most materials are unaggregated and likely to be highly erosive.
  8.  _Sparse vegetation._ Vegetation is either absent, sparse or patchy, often consisting of ephemeral herbaceous plants, mosses or lichens. Mangroves occur mainly on Raw Soils.

## Key to Groups of Raw Soils

### __WG__

Raw Soils that at 30 cm or less from the mineral soil surface have either

  1.  the upper boundary of a reductimorphic horizon, _or_
  2.  sufficient active ferrous iron to give a positive reaction to a,a'-dipyridyl at some time in the year, _or_
  3.  are saturated for 30 or more consecutive days in most years.

## Key to Subgroups of Raw Soils

### __WG__ GLEY RAW SOILS

Gley Raw Soils occur in sites that are periodically or permanently flooded. Wetness is expressed in the soil by grey colours with brownish or reddish mottles, by water saturation or is indicated by a chemical test for the presence of reduced iron.

#### __WGFU__

  1.  moderately fluid or very fluid fluidity class at a depth of 30 cm or less, _and_
  2.  pH more than 4.0 and pH in boiling hydrogen peroxide less than 3.0, in some horizon at less than 90 cm from the mineral soil surface.
