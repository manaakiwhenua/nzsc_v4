# Raw Soils {-#ord-W}

## Concept of the Order {-#con-W}

Raw Soils lack distinct topsoil development or are fluid at a shallow depth. They occur in environments where the development of topsoils is prevented by rockiness, by active erosion, or deposition. They include beach sands, alpine rock areas and active screes, lagoons and tidal estuaries.

## Correlation {-#cor-W}

Raw Soils correspond in part with very weakly developed recent soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification, and in part with materials that were often not considered to be soil. They are either Entisols or are unclassified in Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {-#occ-W}

Raw Soils occur scattered throughout New Zealand, particularly in association with high mountains, braided rivers, beaches and tidal mudflats.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {-#acc-W}

1.  _No B horizons._ Pedogenetic horizons are lacking apart from a rudimentary topsoil.
2.  _Fresh or weakly weathered._ Coarse fragments and sand particles are generally without coatings, although clasts in some screes may have weathering rinds.
3.  _Inherited mineralogy._ The soil mineralogy is very similar to that of the parent material and a range of mineralogy classes is possible.
4.  _In soils with a fluid subsurface layer, a continuously high water-table is present._ The deposition of fresh sediment may occur.
5.  _Non-fluid soils occur in environments with active erosion or deposition._
6.  _Low fertility._ Nitrogen in particular, is deficient.
7.  _Erosive._ Most materials are unaggregated and likely to be highly erosive.
8.  _Sparse vegetation._ Vegetation is either absent, sparse or patchy, often consisting of ephemeral herbaceous plants, mosses or lichens. Mangroves occur mainly on Raw Soils.
