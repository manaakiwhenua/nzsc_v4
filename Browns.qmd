# Brown Soils {#ord-B .unnumbered}

## Concept of the Order {#con-B .unnumbered}

Brown Soils usually contain 2:1 clay minerals. Secondary iron oxides tend to be evenly dispersed through the soil and give a yellowish brown colour to the upper part of the B horizon. Base saturation values are usually moderate to very low.

## Correlation {#cor-B .unnumbered}

The order comprises moderately and weakly weathered yellow-brown earths, yellow-brown sands, southern brown-granular loams and clays, and intergrades from yellow-brown earths to yellow-grey earths, podzols, brown-granular soils, and recent soils, as well as associated steepland soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. The soils predominantly correlate with the Dystrochrepts of Soil Taxonomy, except for some stony and sandy soils which are Ustochrepts or Psamments.

## Occurrence {#occ-B .unnumbered}

Brown Soils occur in places in which summer dryness is uncommon and that are not waterlogged in winter. They are the most extensive New Zealand soils.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#acc-B .unnumbered}

1.  *Dispersed secondary oxides.* Secondary iron and aluminium oxides are dispersed throughout the soil mass. The soil is brunified (i.e. iron and aluminium oxides form coatings around phyllosilicate clay particles and form bridges between these particles and humus). P retention is moderate to very high.
2.  *Low to moderate base saturation.* Base saturation values in subsoils are usually less than 50%, and KCl-extractable aluminium levels are usually more than 1.5 cmol(+)/kg except where clay contents are relatively low.
3.  *Parent materials are mostly weakly weathered.* [Mafic Brown Soils](#BM) are derived from weakly weathered intermediate or basic igneous rocks (e.g. phonolite and basalt). Other groups are derived dominantly from acid quartzo-feldspathic sedimentary rocks (schist and greywacke) or acid igneous rocks (e.g. rhyolites and granites).The alteration status of gravel or hard rock substrates is usually fresh to moderately weathered and occasionally highly weathered.
4.  *Mica/illite and vermiculite are common clay minerals.* Profiles tend to be mineralogically uniform with depth. Brown soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes. Mixed, Illitic, Vermiculitic and Clay-mineralic (involving vermiculite and mica-vermiculite) are common. Some [Allophanic Brown Soils](#BA) have an Amorphic mineralogy class.
5.  *Good Drainage.* No poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are included. Macroporosity is generally moderate (10--14%) except in subsurface horizons of [Firm Brown Soils](#BF).
6.  *Biologically active.* Except in soils that are limited by coldness or acidity, cast spheroidal peds are common in topsoils and C/N ratios are moderate to low. The roots of native plants penetrate deeply.
7.  *Relatively stable topsoils.* Aggregates are not readily dispersed.
8.  *Moist climate or low available-water capacity.* Most soils occur in areas with mean annual precipitation more than 1000 mm. Others have low available-water capacity (usually less than 75 mm as in some Stony Brown Soils and [Sandy Brown Soils](#BS)), or are in sites with low evapotranspiration.
