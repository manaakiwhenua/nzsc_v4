# Melanic Soils {#ord-E .unnumbered}

## Concept of the Order {#con-E .unnumbered}

Melanic Soils are soils with high base saturations, well structured, very dark A horizons, and with weakly alkaline or weakly acid subsurface horizons. Their parent materials are rich in calcium and/or magnesium.

## Correlation {#cor-E .unnumbered}

The Melanic Soils include the rendzinas and rendzic intergrades to yellow-grey earths and yellow-brown earths. They also include the weakly weathered and drier brown-granular loams and clays of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. Most correlate with Mollisols and a few with Vertisols and Inceptisols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {#occ-E .unnumbered}

Melanic Soils are scattered throughout New Zealand in association with calcareous or basaltic rocks.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#acc-E .unnumbered}

1.  *Swelling clays.* Most soils have smectite, or minerals with interstratifications of smectite, in the clay mineral assemblage. Melanic Soils usually have a Smectitic, Illitic or Kandic mineralogy class.
2.  *High base saturations.* Base saturations are usually more than 50%, and KCl-extractable aluminium values are usually very low.
3.  *Stable structure.* Structural stability of topsoils is high with relatively large amounts of organic carbon intimately associated with clay minerals. The soils are likely to have relatively high resistance to structural damage under heavy cropping unless organic matter is reduced significantly. The porosity is stabilised by divalent ion/organic matter/ clay complexes.
4.  *High shrink/swell.* The soil materials are sticky and plastic. They are expected to have significant shrink/swell potential, expressed in high coefficient of linear expandibility values. This is reflected in strong polyhedral, blocky or prismatic pedality. Pretentions are moderate to high.
5.  *Fertile.* Exchangeable calcium and magnesium values are high, particularly at the base of profile.
6.  *Parent materials.* The soils are derived from calcareous rocks or from mafic or ultramafic rocks (e.g. basalt or peridotite).
7.  *Deep rooting.* Except for shallow soils on rock or soils affected by high water-tables, potential rooting depths are relatively large.
8.  *Biologically active.* Carbon/nitrogen ratios are low (except in areas with very high precipitation).
