# Organic Soils {#sec-ord-O}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-O}

Organic Soils are soils that occur in the partly decomposed remains of wetland plants (peat) or thick forest litter. Mineral soil material is commonly present but [organic soil material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-org) is dominant. The soils occur in sites where rates of organic matter decomposition are balanced or exceeded by rates of plant biomass production and accumulation.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-O}

The order corresponds with the organic soils group of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*. It correlates with the Histosols of *Soil Taxonomy*.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-O}

Organic Soils occur in wetlands in most parts of New Zealand with species of the Restionaceae family as the main peat former, or under forest-produced acidic litter in areas with high precipitation.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-O}

1.  *Low bulk density.* Due to the high organic matter content, bulk densities are very low, usually in the range of 0.03 to 0.4 Mg/m^3^. Too few data are yet available to allow mineralogy classes to be stated.
2.  *High cation exchange capacity.* The organic components of Organic Soils have high surface area, and high negative charge that varies markedly with pH. CEC values are very high, mostly ranging from 40 to 170 cmol~c~/kg.
3.  *High carbon/nitrogen ratios.* C/N ratios range from 18 to as high as 70 in unfertilised and uncultivated Organic Soils.
4.  *Low bearing strength.* Construction of buildings or roads requires special foundation design.
5.  *Very low thermal conductivity.* Soils warm and cool slowly. Bare soil surfaces, however, have high radiance.
6.  *High shrinkage potential.* The soils shrink markedly upon drying, and lose organic matter due to oxidation. Consequently, following drainage, the classification may change.
7.  *High total available water capacity.* While total available water capacity is high, plant-available water capacity may only be moderate, due to limits in rooting depth (anoxic conditions, species-specific limitations).
8.  *Common nutrient deficiencies.* The major nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur, and the trace elements copper, selenium and molybdenum, are frequently deficient for crops and pasture.
9.  *Peats are very poorly drained, whereas litters are variable.* In their natural state, Organic Soils formed in peats are very poorly drained and those formed from litters may range from well drained to very poorly drained. Most Organic Soils from peat in New Zealand have been artificially drained, leading to drastic shifts towards drier soil moisture conditions.

## Key to Groups of Organic Soils {#sec-grp-O}

#### **OL** {#sec-key-OL .unnumbered}

Organic Soils that occur entirely in partly or fully decomposed forest litter and are not almost continually saturated in the natural state (F and H horizons).

Other soils that, from the upper surface of the [organic soil material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-org) to 60 cm depth, or to the base of the organic soil material if shallower, have horizons dominated (by accumulated thickness) by fibric organic soil material (Of horizons).
