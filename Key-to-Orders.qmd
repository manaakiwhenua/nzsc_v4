# Key to Soil Orders {#sec-key}

In the keys to orders, groups or subgroups, any surface layer of new material, e.g. fresh alluvium, that is less than 30 cm thick, is not considered as part of the soil for assignment to orders, groups or subgroups, except in the [Recent Soils](Recents.qmd#sec-ord-R) or [Raw Soils](Raws.qmd#sec-ord-W), or [Sulfuric Gley](Gleys.qmd#sec-key-GU) or [Recent Gley](Gleys.qmd#sec-key-GR) groups of the [Gley Soils](Gleys.qmd#sec-ord-G). A surface layer of new material can be recognised because it will not meet the requirements of the key for any order or group except those specified above. Transitional horizons (e.g. AB or A/B horizons) are not included when considering horizon notations in the key unless explicitly stated.

::: {#nte-othk .callout-note title="Overthickened A horizons" appearance="minimal"}
If any soil has an overthickened A horizon with its base at 45 cm or more from the mineral soil surface , does not contain [anthropic soil material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-anthro) with combined thickness of \>30 cm within 90 cm of the soil surface, and is not mottled within 30 cm of the mineral surface, the key should be entered directly at [Recent Soils](#sec-R).
:::

::: {#nte-arest .callout-note title="Restored Anthropic Soils" appearance="minimal"}
Soils that have been drastically disturbed and may contain [anthropic soil material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-anthro) but have been restored to the extent that they will meet the requirements of orders other than [Recent Soils](#sec-R) or [Raw Soils](#sec-W), will not be assigned to [Anthropic Soils](#sec-A). For this reason, Anthropic Soils are placed late in the key to soil orders but before Recent Soils and Raw Soils. Restoration may refer to re-establishing the (near-)original soil type but in most cases aims at re-enabling selected soil functions to allow for an intended use (FAO 2025).
