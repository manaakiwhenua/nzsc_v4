# Recent Soils {#sec-ord-R}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-R}

Recent Soils show only incipient marks of soil-forming processes because of youthfulness, truncation of an older solum or, less commonly, because the soil material is resistant to alteration. Soil formation has been sufficient to develop a [distinct topsoil](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-dts), or as in the case of fine-textured wetland soils, to have moderately fluid or very fluid layers not close to the surface, indicating the onset of pedogenesis. A continuous cover of vascular plants is normally well established. The concept of the order relates predominantly to weak soil development rather than to the length of time of soil formation.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-R}

The order correlates with the recent soils, but not the gleyed-recent soils, of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*. It correlates mainly with Entisols but overlaps with some Inceptisols and Andisols of *Soil Taxonomy*.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-R}

Recent soils occur throughout New Zealand in young landscapes, including alluvial floodplains, unstable slopes and slopes mantled by young tephra deposits within the past \~700 years, including rhyolitic, andesitic and basaltic tephras [@hopkins2021].

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-R}

1.  *Weak soil development.* Soil development is mostly confined to topsoils, with B horizon colours and/or pedality occurring in some soils.
2.  *Base saturations are generally high.* Base saturations are usually high except in very humid areas.
3.  *Coarse rock fragments, bedrock, or pyroclastic materials are not strongly altered.* The alteration status usually ranges from fresh to moderately weathered.
4.  *Illitic mineralogy.* The soil mineralogy reflects the mineralogy of the parent material. Most Recent Soils have an Illitic mineralogy class except for those formed in tephra which are usually Glassy.
5.  *Deep rooting.* Although textures vary, potential rooting depths are mostly large. Subsurface horizons are usually apedal or weakly pedal, and penetration resistance may be low in some soils.
6.  *Good drainage.* Poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are not included.
7.  *Low phosphate retention.* Phosphate retention is likely to be either low or very low unless the soils occur in mafic parent materials.
8.  *High fertility.* Natural fertility is generally high.
9.  *Subject to erosion or sedimentation, including tephra deposition.* The soils are susceptible to erosion, sedimentation and/or tephra deposition.
