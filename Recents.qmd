# Recent Soils {#ord-R .unnumbered}

## Concept of the Order {#con-R .unnumbered}

Recent Soils show only incipient marks of soil-forming processes because of youthfulness, truncation of an older solum or, less commonly, because the soil material is resistant to alteration. Soil formation has been sufficient to develop a distinct topsoil, or as in the case of fine-textured wetland soils, to have ripened sufficiently that fluid layers are not close to the surface. A continuous cover of vascular plants is normally well established. The concept of the order relates predominantly to weak soil development rather than to the length of time of soil formation.

## Correlation {#cor-R .unnumbered}

The order correlates with the recent soils, but not the gleyed-recent soils, of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification, and includes Entisols and some Inceptisols and Andisols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {#occ-R .unnumbered}

Recent soils occur throughout New Zealand in young landscapes, including alluvial floodplains, unstable steep slopes and slopes mantled by young volcanic ash.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#acc-R .unnumbered}

1.  *Weak soil development.* Soil development is mostly confined to topsoils, with B horizon colours and/or pedality occurring in some soils.
2.  *Base saturations are generally high.* Base saturations are usually high except in very humid areas.
3.  *Gravel or rock is not strongly altered.* The alteration status of gravel or rock usually ranges from fresh to moderately weathered.
4.  *Illitic mineralogy.* The soil mineralogy reflects the mineralogy of the parent material. Most Recent Soils have an Illitic mineralogy class except for those formed in tephra which are usually Glassy.
5.  *Deep rooting.* Although textures vary, potential rooting depths are mostly large. Subsurface horizons are usually apedal or weakly pedal and penetration may be limited in some soils.
6.  *Good drainage.* Poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are not included.
7.  *Low P retention.* P retentions are likely to be either low or very low unless the soils occur in mafic materials.
8.  *High fertility.* Natural fertility is generally high.
9.  *Subject to erosion or sedimentation.* The soils are susceptible to erosion and/or sedimentation.
