# Anthropic Soils {#sec-ord-A}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-A}

Anthropic Soils are soils that have been created or significantly altered by human activity. This includes the truncation (i.e. excavation) of natural soils by earth-moving equipment, the relocation of soils from their original sites, or the mixing of natural soils in a way that significantly alters their original character. Additionally, Anthropic soils may be formed through the deposition of thick layers of organic matter or inorganic material that may also contain artefacts. Their classification reflects the way in which they were created or altered, and the kinds of materials used.

If the original soil type is known to at least order level, it has to be appended to the taxa name in parentheses. If unknown, this also has to be stated as parentheses, for example, ‘Typic Truncated Anthropic Soil (unknown soil)’ or ‘Typic Mixed Anthropic Soil (Perch-gley Pallic Soil)’. Evidence of the likely original soil type can be sourced from legacy soil maps (also geological maps, aerial imagery, etc.), and by correlation with non-anthropic soils found in a similar geomorphological context (e.g., non-Anthropic Soils of the same landform).

Note that soils that have been drastically disturbed but have been restored to the extent that they will meet the requirements of orders other than [Recent Soils](#sec-ord-R) or [Raw Soils](#sec-ord-W), will not be assigned to Anthropic Soils. For this reason Anthropic soils are placed late in the Key to Orders but before Recent Soils and Raw Soils.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-A}

Anthropic Soils were not formally part of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*, although Anthropic soils were described in some soil survey reports. In *Soil Taxonomy*, the soils either correlate with soils containing an Anthropic or Plaggen Epipedon, Entisols, or are unclassified.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-A}

In New Zealand, common land-use scenarios with a high occurrence of Anthropic Soils are:

-   Land development processes and construction in urban and peri-urban environments (e.g., urban/industrial construction, residential sub-division development, landscaping/soil restoration, dumping of excavated soil, infrastructure construction \[roads, rail, ports, underground utilities\])
-   Areas affected by mining activities (e.g., truncation by open-cast mining, sluicing of unconsolidated sediments, deposition of tailings and overburden, soil restoration)
-   Infrastructure construction linked to agricultural activities (e.g., farm dams, buried irrigation lines, offal pits)
-   Deep soil inversion to break pedogenic pans in the subsurface or expose buried tephra layers especially in regions with naturally occurring Podzol Soils or tephra deposition
-   Deep ripping/excavation linked to intensive forestry
-   Regions with long history of Māori settlement (e.g., Maungawhau terraces, Waimea Plains)
-   Closed landfills.

Although not necessarily covering extensive areas, soils sufficiently altered by Māori are of particular cultural interest as the oldest examples of anthropogenic alteration of soils in New Zealand.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-A}

1.  Soil characteristics and the relationships between soils and landforms do not have the orderliness of natural soils.
2.  While drainage change alone is not a qualifying criteria for Anthropic Soils, drainage has often been altered significantly from the original state, in addition to other anthropogenic modifications (e.g., mixing of original soil horizons).
3.  Soil properties depend upon both the nature of the manufactured or natural materials and the nature of the soil manipulation.
4.  Land surfaces are artificial (i.e., constructed by humans).

## Key to Groups of Anthropic Soils {#sec-grp-A}

#### **AT** {#sec-key-AT .unnumbered}

Anthropic Soils that have been affected by truncation of the solum by the action of people and meet BOTH of the following criteria:

1. The truncation reached at least as deep as the lower boundary of an *in-situ* A or AB horizon (i.e., to the upper boundary of the B horizon or deeper), AND
2. If the truncated surface is overlain by relocated soil or rock material (e.g. for landscaping purposes, the natural *in-situ* materials must occur within 30 cm of the soil surface.

#### **AO** {#sec-key-AO .unnumbered}

Other Anthropic Soils that have been modified or altered through Māori cultural practice, often forming a distinct ‘cultural layer’ with artefacts (e.g. midden sites) and associated with modifications of the soil surface (e.g., terraces, borrow pits). These soils meet BOTH of the following criteria:

1.  Contain additions to horizon(s) in the form of manufactured or natural mineral (e.g. rock fragments, sand), organic or biogenic material (e.g. seaweed, charcoal, ash, shells) thrugh Māori cultural practice; AND
2.  The modified horizon(s) have a combined thickness of at least 30 cm, with an upper boundary either at the land surface or within 90 cm if buried.

## Key to Subgroups of Anthropic Soils {#sec-sub-A}

### **AT** - TRUNCATED ANTHROPIC SOILS {#sec-AT .unnumbered}

Truncated Anthropic Soils result from cutting away any existing soil, typically by mechanical equipment, leaving material that would be recognised as a E, B, BC, C, CR or R horizon. The scalped surface may be overlain by <30 cm of soil, deposited for landscaping purposes.

#### **ATX** {#sec-key-ATX .unnumbered}

Truncated Anthropic Soils with a [lithic](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-lithc) or [paralithic contact](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-plith) within 60 cm of the soil surface.

#### **ATT** {#sec-key-ATT .unnumbered}

Other soils.

::: {style="text-align: right"}
**Typic Truncated Anthropic Soils**
:::

### **AO** - MĀORI ANTHROPIC SOILS {#sec-AO .unnumbered}

These soils are attributed to Māori cultural activity, such as Māori-initiated construction or burial, gardening and horticultural practice, or signs of customary resource activity. Māori Anthropic Soils occur throughout New Zealand, at sites where Māori cultural activity has significantly altered the soil profile, mainly through redistribution of soil from original sites (excavation combined with fill). Examples include pā sites, trenches, terraces, cultural fortifications, papa kāinga (villages), ūrupa (burial sites). For gardening, horticulture, and cropping soil management practices result in the addition of local mineral material (e.g., rock fragments and sand) or the addition of organic or biogenic material (e.g., seaweed, charcoal, [fire] ash, shells), to ameliorate and enhance the physical, chemical, and biological properties of a soil (e.g., soil fertility, drainage, aeration, temperature). Customary resource activity often results in waste material altering soils and landforms (e.g., middens).

#### **AOA** {#sec-key-AOA .unnumbered}

Māori Anthropic Soils with a horizon containing Māori artefacts or other manufactured material (e.g., some middens), or a horizon resulting from excavation and redistribution of soil material for construction purposes (e.g., pā sites, fortifications, ūrupa).

### **AM** - MIXED ANTHROPIC SOILS {#sec-AM .unnumbered}

Mixed Anthropic Soils occur where the original soil has been disturbed by mechanical procedures such as deep ripping, lifting, flipping or recontouring (e.g. hump-and-hollowing) within (peri-)urban settings or to modify soil characteristics such as increasing fertility or breaking up drainage-impeding horizons (e.g. [placic horizons](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-plac), [ortstein-](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-opan) or [ironstone-pans](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-ipan)).
