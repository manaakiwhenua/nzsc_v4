# Pallic Soils {#ord-P .unnumbered}

## Concept of the Order {#con-P .unnumbered}

Pallic Soils are soils with moderate to high base status and low contents of secondary iron oxides. They have pale colours, high slaking potential and high density in subsurface horizons. Pallic Soils have water deficits in summer, and soil water surpluses in winter or spring.

## Correlation {#cor-P .unnumbered}

The order comprises most yellow-grey earths, associated steepland soils, intergrades between yellow-grey earths and yellow-brown earths, and intergrades between yellow-grey earths and brown-grey earths of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. Most Pallic Soils are either Aqualfs, Aquepts, Ustalfs, Udalfs or Ochrepts.

## Occurrence {#occ-P .unnumbered}

Pallic Soils occur predominantly in the seasonally dry eastern part of North and South Islands and in the Manawatu.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#acc-P .unnumbered}

1.  *Low concentrations of secondary oxides.* P retention is less than 30% in topsoils and, usually, in subsoils. Extractable iron and aluminium values are low or moderate with a significant proportion of secondary iron oxides occurring in [redox segregations](#diag-rsegs).
2.  *High base status.* Base saturation values in subsoils are high (more than 50%) except in perch-gleyed soils, where values may be lower in horizons overlying [fragipans](#diag-fpan).
3.  *Siliceous parent materials.* Parent materials are predominantly loess or sediments derived from quartzo-feldspathic rocks (schist or greywacke).
4.  *Mica/illite clay minerals.* Pallic Soils usually belong either to the Illitic or to a Clay-mineralic mineralogy class.
5.  *Slow permeability.* Subsurface horizons have restricted permeability, particularly in soils with fragipans or duripans in which the permeability is very slow.
6.  *Perched water-tables.* Soils that are poorly or moderately well drained have water-tables perched on [slowly permeable layers](#diag-slowp).
7.  *Limited root depth.* Potential rooting depth in most soils is limited by a subsurface horizon of high bulk density at shallow depths or by brittle silty cappings on stones.
8.  *Strongly worm-mixed.* Topsoils generally have a significant proportion of worm casts and a distinct worm-mixed horizon occurs in the transition from A to B horizons. Topsoil worm activity is greatly reduced during summer periods of soil moisture deficit.
9.  *High slaking and dispersion potential.* Soil material, particularly in B horizons, is strongly dispersive and will readily slake. Topsoil structures may break down under prolonged impact by heavy machinery or by continuous tillage.
10. *Droughty summers, moist winters.* Precipitation ranges from about 500 to 1000 mm per year. A spring surplus of soil water is common but the annual surplus is less than about 200 mm. The average annual deficit is approximately 90--200 mm/year.
11. *Phosphorus status.* A high proportion of the inorganic phosphorus is non-occluded and a relatively high proportion of total phosphorus is in an organic form.
12. *Sulphur status.* Levels of extractable sulphate are low.

## Key to Subgroups of Pallic Soils {#sub-P .unnumbered}

### **PP** - PERCH-GLEY PALLIC SOILS {#PP .unnumbered}

Perch-gley Pallic soils occur in sites that are periodically saturated (if undrained) in winter and spring, but dry out in summer. The wetness and associated reducing conditions are indicated by grey colours on ped surfaces in horizons subjacent to the topsoil. Wetness is caused by perching of water on a slowly permeable subsurface layer, either a [fragipan](#diag-fpan), [argillic horizon](#diag-argh), [duripan](#diag-dpan), some combination of these horizons or other slowly permeable layer. The [reductimorphic horizons](#diag-redmh) are commonly acidic (pH less than 5.5).
