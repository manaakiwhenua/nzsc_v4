# Pumice Soils

## Concept of the Order

Pumice soils are soils that have properties dominated by a pumiceous and glassy skeleton with a low content of clay (which typically contains allophane). They occur in sandy or pumiceous tephra ranging from 700 to 3500 years in age.

## Correlation

Pumice Soils include the yellow-brown pumice soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification, and a few yellow-brown loams with high glass content and moderate P retention. They correlate mainly with the Vitrands, Vitricryands or Vitraquands of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence

Pumice Soils occur in sandy or pumiceous volcanic ashes which are relatively young. They are distributed in the central North Island, particularly in the Volcanic Plateau.

## Accessory Properties of the Order

  1.  _Short-range-order clay minerals._ Clay contents are low, generally less than 10%. The clay minerals are dominantly allophane and imogolite and occur as coatings around glass or pumice particles. Phosphateretention is moderate or high. Most Pumice Soils belong to the Glassy or Amorphic mineralogy classes.
  2.  _Low soil strengths._ Soil strength is weak or very weak. The soils are apedal earthy or single-grain or extremely fine spheroidal, except in welded layers which are massive and may have higher strength.
  3.  _Pumice is not strongly altered._ The alteration status of pumice gravel ranges from fresh to moderately weathered. Glass is predominant in sand fractions.
  4.  _Deep rooting._ The soils provide a deep rooting medium except in welded flow tephras.
  5.  _Very high macroporosity._ The macroporosity enables rapid drainage at low soil-water tensions. The available water content is high.
  6.  _Sensitive._ The soils are non-plastic and are sensitive, with low strength when disturbed.
  7. _Resistant to pugging._ Water contents at field capacity are less than the plastic limit. Pumice Soils may, however, be susceptible to compaction on loading, with consequent reduced infiltration.
  8.  _Low reserves of major nutrient elements._ Sulphur, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium are usually required for agricultural or horticultural crops. Reserve potassium (Kc) is low and exchangeable magnesium is very low, particularly in subsoils.
  9.  _Trace elements are likely to be deficient._ Trace elements that are possibly deficient include cobalt, copper, molybdenum, boron, iodine and selenium.
  10.  _Erosive._ The potential for erosion by water is high.

## Key to Groups of Pumice Soils

### __MP__

Pumice Soils that have both 

  1.  a gley profile form, _and_
  2.  perch-gley features.

### __MI__

Other Pumic Soils that have a slowly permeable layer, or a compacted welded layer that has brittle failure and no roots, within 90 cm of the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> IMPEDED PUMICE SOILS </div>

### __MO__

Other Pumice Soils.

## Key to Subgroups of Pumice Soils

### __MP__ PERCH-GLEY PUMICE SOILS

Perch-gley Pumice Soils occur in periodically saturated sites (unless artificially drained) in which wetness is indicated by grey colours along with brownish or reddish mottles. The wetness is caused by perching of water on a slowly permeable subsurface layer, although a groundwater-table may also be present.

### __MPU__

Perch-gley Pumice Soils with a duric horizon  within 90 cm of the mineral soil surface.

### __MPT__

Other soils.

<div style="text-align: right"> Typic Perch-gley Pumice Soils </div>

### __MI__ IMPEDED PUMICE SOILS

Impeded Pumice Soils have a horizon that severely restricts the movement of water and usually the penetration of roots. The restrictive horizon is commonly a layer of welded pumice.

#### __MIMW__

Impeded Pumice Soils that have both

  1.  a compact welded layer of flow tephra (ignimbrite) that has brittle failure and no roots with an upper boundary within 90 cm of the mineral soil surface, _and_
  2.  a mottled profile form.

Other soils that have a layer within the thickness of vitric soil material, that meets the requirements of an allophanic soil material (except for bulk density).

#### __MOBL__

Other soils with a layer of vitric soil material with a base at less than 60 cm from the mineral soil surface and within the B horizon, that overlies a layer which fails to meet the requirements of a vitric soil material but meets the requirements of allophanic soil material (except bulk density).
