# Oxidic Soils

## Concept of the Order

Oxidic Soils contain low-activity phyllosilicate clays and secondary oxides which give rise to variable charge properties. They form in the clayey weathering products of basic rocks. The soils have a fine or very fine polyhedral fabric with friable failure to stable microaggregates of 2 mm or less, and low plasticity in relation to clay content. Surface horizons are clayey, and an increase in clay content occurs with depth although clay illuvial features are generally not apparent.

## Correlation

The order comprises most of the strongly weathered red loams and brown loams, many northern brown granular clays, and a few brown granular soils from ash beds and basaltic and andesitic rocks of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. It correlates with the Oxisols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence

Oxidic Soils are only known to occur in the Auckland and Northland regions.

## Accessory Properties of the Order

  1.  _Low-activity clay._ CEC is low at field pH. ECEC is less than 12 cmol/kg (clay), and CEC less than 16 cmol/kg (clay). The soils are weakly buffered. Some subhorizons have a net positive charge. Oxidic Soils usually have the following mineralogy classes: Kandic, Ferritic or Aluminitic.
  2.  _High phosphate retention._ P-retention ranges from 60 to 90%. High sulphate adsorption occurs in B horizons.
  3.  _Parent materials._ The soils are derived from andesites, dolerites and basalts of Tertiary to Upper Cretaceous age.
  4.  _Limited root depth._ The extension of plant roots is limited by high dry bulk density and high penetration resistance, particularly in well drained soils. Plant root depths are shallow to medium.
  5.  _Moderate or rapid infiltration._ Hydraulic conductivity of surface horizons and upper B horizons is moderate or faster, giving excellent trafficability and workability immediately after rain.
  6.  _Slow permeability._ Hydraulic conductivity decreases to slow or margin- ally slow values with depth, such that perching of water occurs within the root zone after high intensity rainfalls. The duration of wetness varies from 1 to 2 days in well drained soils to 4 days or more in poorly drained soils.
  7.  _Soil water deficit._ Deficits occur in summer and are exacerbated by low readily available water capacities and shallow rooting depths.
  8.  _High clay contents._ Clay content ranges from 50 to 90%.
  9.  _Well developed structure._ Topsoils have mostly well developed spheroidal or polyhedral peds. Topsoil bulk densities are low.
  10.  _Strongly weathered with very low nutrient reserves._ The soils have very low reserves of potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus.

## Key to Groups of Oxidic Soils

### __XP__

Oxidic soils Soils that have both

  1.  a gley profile form, _and_
  2.  perch-gley features.

### __XN__

Other Oxidic soils Soils that have a nodular horizon with an upper boundary within 60 cm of the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> NODULAR OXIDIC SOILS </div>

### __XO__

## Key to Subgroups of Oxidic Soils

### __XP__ PERCH-GLEY OXIDIC SOILS

Perch-gley Oxidic Soils occur in sites that are periodically saturated (unless artificially drained). Wetness and associated reducing conditions are indicated by grey colours, and are caused by perching on a slowly permeable layer.

#### __XPN__

Perch-gley Oxidic soils Soils that have a nodular horizon with an upper boundary within 60 cm of the mineral soil surface.

<div style="text-align: right"> Nodular Perch-gley Oxidic Soils </div>

#### __XPT__

Other soils.

<div style="text-align: right"> Typic Perch-gley Oxidic Soils </div>

### __XN__ NODULAR OXIDIC SOILS

Nodular Oxidic Soils occur in clayey soil materials derived from Pliocene or early Pleistocene basalts. They have clay-enriched B horizons and a prominent layer of iron oxide nodules. The soils have extremely low CEC (at natural pH) and natural fertility. Intermittent wetness is usual.

#### __XNT__

Only one subgroup is recognised.

### __XO__ ORTHIC OXIDIC SOILS

Orthic Oxidic Soils occur in clayey soil materials derived from early to mid-Pleistocene basalts. They have clay-enriched B horizons but lack prominent nodules, although up to 2% may be present in some horizons.

#### __XOM__

Orthic Oxidic Soils that have a mottled profile form.

<div style="text-align: right"> Mottled Orthic Oxidic Soils </div>

#### __XOB__

Other soils that have within 90 cm of the mineral soil surface, _either_

  1.  a clay decrease with depth of more than one-fifth of the clay percentage of the horizon with maximum clay, or
  2.  more than 5% weathered gravel, within 90 cm of the min- eral soil surface.
