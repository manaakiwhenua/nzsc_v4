# Podzols {#sec-ord-Z}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-Z}

Podzols are [acidic]{.min} soils with low base saturation. Podzols have an horizon of accumulation of aluminium occurring as complexes with organic matter and/or as short-range-order minerals (typically with silicon as allophane/ imogolite). Iron (typically as ferrihydrite) may or may not be accumulated with aluminium. This horizon is usually associated with an overlying [eluvial horizon](#sec-diag-eluvh) indicating translocation. The [eluvial horizon](#sec-diag-eluvh) may be missing as a result of erosion, ploughing or bioturbation or it may be masked by organic matter.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-Z}

Podzols correspond to the podzols and some podzolised yellow-brown earths of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. They mostly correspond with the Spodosols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-Z}

Podzols occur in areas of high precipitation and are usually associated with forest species which produce an acid litter. [They are most common in Northland, the West Coast of the South Island, and the high country of the North and South Islands.]{.min}

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-Z}

1.  *Secondary oxides strongly differentiated between horizons.* In A and E horizons, sand and silt grains are uncoated. In B horizons they are coated, and in some soils cemented, by short-range-order minerals and/or organic matter.
2.  *Low base saturation.* Base saturations are very low and the soils are extremely acid in A and E horizons. KCl-extractable-aluminium levels are high, and aluminium in soil solution may be toxic to some plants.
3.  *Parent materials.* The soils [are derived predominantly from felsic]{.min} rocks such as granite, greywacke, schist or rhyolite.
4.  *Mineralogically differentiated.* Mica-smectite or smectite often occur in A and E horizons, and hydroxy-coated or interlayered minerals or allophane often occur in the B horizon. In some Northland soils, silica is dominant in B horizons. Podzols cover a wide range of mineralogy classes.
5.  *Limited rooting depth.* The rooting depth is limited for many introduced plants by low pH or aluminium toxicity, or by pans which often cause problems of wetness.
6.  *Low biological activity.* Low levels of faunal activity occur with a low rate of mineralisation. Carbon/nitrogen ratios are very high. The accumulation of weakly decomposed humus and minimal incorporation of humus into the upper mineral soil results in a mor-like humus form.
7.  *Mor-forming vegetation.* The soils have been associated with vegetation producing an acid litter of low nutrient content.
8.  *Infertile.* The soils have very low natural fertility with high nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime requirements.
9.  *Wet climate.* The soils occur mainly in areas with a precipitation of 1400 mm or more and unless sandy, are likely to have a soil water surplus for a considerable part of the year.
