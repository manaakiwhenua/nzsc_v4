# Granular Soils {#sec-ord-N}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-N}

Granular soils are clayey soils in which kaolin-group minerals (especially halloysite) are dominant, and are usually associated with vermiculite and hydrous-interlayered vermiculite, together with iron oxides that generate the common brownish to reddish brown colours for these soils. The soil material comprises polyhedral peds with strength characteristics which change rapidly with water content. Consistence is sticky and plastic. The presence of vermiculite gives these soils a moderate buffering capacity. The soils lack the weak strength, friable failure, low plasticity, and low-activity-clay properties which either define or are accessory to Oxidic Soils. Clay coatings where they occur are thin.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-N}

The order comprises many soils previously classified as brown granular loams and moderately to strongly leached brown granular clays of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*. Most are correlated with the Ultisols of *Soil Taxonomy*.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-N}

Granular Soils are only known to occur in the northern North Island, particularly in the lowlands of the Waikato and South Auckland regions.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-N}

1.  *Moderate activity clay.* CEC is greater than 16 cmol~c~/kg (clay) and ECEC ranges from about 8 to 16 cmol~c~/kg (clay).
2.  *Parent materials.* The soils are derived predominantly from strongly weathered tephras mostly older than 45 000 years, including the widespread Hamilton ash, and also from basaltic and andesitic rocks with possible additions from aeolian material.
3.  *Kandic/Halloysitic mineralogy.* Granular Soils usually belong to the Kandic/Halloysitic mineralogy class.
4.  *Slowly permeable.* Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow or marginally slow somewhere in the profile, resulting in periods of perching of water.
5.  *Limited rooting depth.* The extension of plant roots in subsoils is commonly limited by either high penetration resistance, wetness or aluminium toxicity.
6.  *Limited workability when wet.* Workability and trafficability is constrained by stickiness and plasticity after heavy rainfall, particularly in contrast to [Oxidic Soils](Key-to-Orders.qmd#sec-X). Granular Soils in the Pukekohe area are generally somewhat less constrained than equivalent soils in the Waikato area.
7.  *Low phosphorus status.* Phosphorus fixation may be high, as indicated by high P retention levels.
8.  *Strongly weathered with low nutrient reserves.* Reserves of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are low, particularly in the [Oxidic group](#sec-NX).
9.  *Sulfate in B horizons.* Sulfate tends to be strongly adsorbed in B horizons.
