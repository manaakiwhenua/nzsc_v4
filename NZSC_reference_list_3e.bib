	abstract = {Thick iron oxide pans are a distinctive feature of some soils in Taranaki, New Zealand, which occur on the ringplain, or on terraces of valleys draining the ringplain of Mount Egmont. The pans tend to form in the boundary area between layers of differing texture within the zone of water table fluctuations. The pans are indurated, brittle, and vesicular, and have a black or reddish brown appearance with a shiny black fracture. They are up to 50 cm thick and form lenticular deposits sometimes several metres across at depths ranging from a few centimetres to about 1 m. Analysis of seven samples of pan gave 34-45\% elemental Fe, 3-5\% A1 and 4-10\% Si, consistent with about 55-70\% iron oxides, together with entrapped and adhering soil particles. V and Mo are enriched in the pan samples and probably occur as anionic species strongly adsorbed on the iron oxide surfaces. X-ray powder diffraction, Moessbauer spectroscopy and acid-oxalate dissolution indicate that the dominant iron oxides present are goethite and ferrihydrite. The relative proportion of these two minerals varies widely without any noticeable change in the nature of the pan materials. Microstructures in one sample were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The pans are considered to have formed from the aeration of groundwaters (rich in ferrous ions) moving laterally through the soils. Such groundwaters are formed on Mount Egmont from the reaction of meteoric water, sometimes containing dissolved volcanic carbon dioxide, with ferromagnesian minerals. Positive tests for ferrous ions (using á,á'-dipyridyl as indicator) were obtained from groundwaters presently associated with the pans.},

A field test for ferric-organic complexes in soils, using the same vials, is proposed. This is based on the photochemical nature of the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron in the presence of oxidizable organic ligands. Two subsamples of soil are added to separate vials, and light is excluded from one. After 5-15 min, a positive test for ferrous iron in the vial exposed to light, and a negative test in the other, indicates the presence of ferric-organic complexes.},

Subsequent sections describe the morphology, micromorphology, chemistry and mineralogy of placic horizons, and include comprehensive data on the chemistry of New Zealand examples. The genesis of placic horizons is reviewed in the light of their chemical and mineralogical composition , and the role of the placic horizon in Soil Taxonomy is examined.

It is concluded that most placic horizons are composed of ferrihydrite, poorly crystalline goethite and organic matter and occur in strongly acid soils which are periodically wet in upper horizons. The formation of placic horizons is ascribed to redox mechanisms and acid leaching of soluble organic matter. On genetic grounds, the horizon ahould not be used in the definition of Spodosols but it is an appropriate basis for distinction at great group level.},

A prototype of the standard method was tested on six samples by laboratories in Japan, the United States and New Zealand. There was good agreement on the glass content for one sample but varying amounts of glass were recorded in the others. Differences in volcanic glass contents were due to conscious departures from the standard method, inadequate chemical pretreatment, varying interpretations of what should be counted as glass, and identification problems. There was, however, a consensus on how five out of the six soils sampled should be classified according to the Andisol proposal of 1988. Modifications to the method are proposed which should allow different operators to achieve more consistent results.},

The stratigraphy and status of several other named late Quaternary tephras are also discussed. This compilation brings together all the data, currently scattered through many publications, to make tephrostratigraphy more accessible and more easily used. The nomenclature of tephra formations is discussed and some rationalisations are suggested. The term "tephrology" is suggested as an appropriate title for the field of tephra studies. The deletion of grain-size (ash, lapi1li), shape (breccia), and lithologic (pumice) terms from all formation names is recommended, as is standardisation on a "Tephra Formation" formal Several tephra layers not previously formally named, or without designated type sections, are defined. The dominant ferromagnesian mineral assemblage of each tephra formation has been compiled as an aid to tephra identification. All available radiocarbon ages (384) on each tephra formation are presented, and each age is assessed for reliability in dating the eruption of that tephra. The standard-deviation weighted mean age of the reliable ages has been determined as the best current estimate of the age of each tephra. At least 10 tephra formations have no reliable ages, and efforts should be made to date these.},

	abstract = {One of the great difficulties in soil classification is that soils rarely exist as discrete individuals with clear boundaries. Instead, they grade to other soils across broad transition belts and their boundaries are determined by definition. Two new concepts, the pedon and the soil individual, have been proposed to help clarify relations between the soil continuum and soil taxonomic classes. Pedons are real, natural soil volumes just large enough to show all the soil horizons present and their relationships. Boundaries of pedons do not depend on reference to any taxonomic scheme. A soil individual (polypedon) is also a real soil body; it is a parcel of contiguous pedons all of which have characteristics lying within the defined limits of a single soil series. Pedons may be considered as building blocks that make up both soil taxonomic classes and soil mapping units. Most pedons are too small to exhibit all the characteristics of a soil individual; for example, usually they do not show shape of the soil nor nature of its boundaries with other soils. Soil individuals (polypedons) are the subject of soil taxonomy; they are the real objects that are classified. They are comparable to individual pine trees, individual fish, and individual men.},

In the Andisol proposal of U.S. Soil Taxonomy, both the yellow-brown loams and yellow-brown pumice soils are classified as Andisols. The soils are subdivided according to moisture regime at the
second (Sub-Order) level and then the coarse textured soils ({VITRIC}) are separated from the fine textured soils and other soils at the third (Great Group) level.
1. Following both the New Zealand classification and the Andisol proposal, I have not separated the yellow-brown loams and the yellow-brown pumice soils from each other at a high category.

This proposal is based on studies of specific groups of the {NZ} Genetic Soil Classification. Reports on these and other relevant studies are listed in the bibliography. Since Version 1.0, most of the previous orders have been extensively revised and new or{\textasciitilde}ers, including Oxidic Soils, Melanous Soils and Raw Soils have been defined. Groups and subgroups have been defined for 13 of the proposed 15 orders. Many of the criteria requiring laboratory analyses have been replaced by criteria based on reproduceable field morphological properties, or analyses that can be performed in the field, or in a field office.\_ This has been aided by development of the new soil description handbook (Milne et al. 1989) and the new soil horizon notation system of Clayden and Hewitt (1989). 

The development of the Raw Soils order is the consequence of a more inclusive concept of "soil". Rather than restricting soil to the earth materials that support plant life, a wider view is taken that regards as soil, any natural material at the
earths surface that has the potential to support plant life. This accords better with the engineering concept of soil, and the technology of modern plant culture. 

The nomenclature in Version 2.0 is still not regarded as final. The deyelopment of a user-friendly, connotative nomenclature is most important and further, help will be welcomed.

Version 2.0 is not a comprehensive classification of {NZ} soils. It must be regarded initially as a classification of a set of well characterised pedons. Testing of this version will enable the evolution of a more comprehensive system.},

	title = {Methods for chemical analysis of soils},
	url = {http://doi.org.landcareresearch.idm.oclc.org/10.7931/DL1-SBSR-80},
	abstract = {The first comprehensive account of the chemical analytical methods that were being used by {NZ} Soil Bureau, 'Methods of Chemical Analysis for Soil Survey Samples' by A. J. Metson ({NZ} Soil Bureau Bulletin 12), was published in 1956. This provided background information on the purpose of the determinations and on the technical details of the methods. 

In the following years, soil chemistry made tremendous advances and many new analytical techniques were developed which improved the speed and accuracy of standard analytical procedures and facilitated measurement of a wider range of properties.

These developments were incorporated in the first edition of {NZ} Soil Bureau Scientific Report {JOA}, published in 1972. This publication was written with a minimum amount of explanatory information on the principles of the methods and application of the results. It described new methods or new techniques that had been developed since 1956, some of which required modem and expensive equipment.

The 1977 revised edition incorporated improvements in instrumental methods developed within the Soil Analysis Section at Soil Bureau. Also, some changes to procedures, and to the ratings for chemical properties were made. Most concentrations were changed to {SI} units, with the exception of cation exchange properties, where the expression milliequivalents was retained.

The second revision (1981) included several changes to techniques and terminology. Some were relatively minor, but those concerning determination of extractable sulphur and oxalate-extractable Al, Fe and Si were quite major. The use of 'Soil Taxonomy' for classification of soils by Soil Bureau, on a trial basis, made it necessary for several additional analyses to be done. These were {pHNaF}, {KCl}-extractable Al, exchange acidity, dithionite-citrate Fe and Al, and pyrophosphate-
extractable Fe and {AL} Details of methods for these determinations were included.

This new publication, which now replaces {NZ} Soil Bureau Scientific Report 10A, includes minor changes to existing methods and the addition of the following methods:
Pyrophosphate-extractable carbon
2 M {KCl}-extractable nitrate
Olsen-soluble phosphorus
Bray 2-soluble phosphorus
Total phosphorus ({NaOH} fusion)
Leaching by automatic extractor (for cation exchange properties)
Cation exchange properties determined by silver thiourea extraction
Phosphate-extractable sulphate determined by {AutoAnalyzer}.
In addition, a new system of numbering the methods has been used. The first number indicates a property or group of properties; the other letters and numbers before the decimal point indicate different methods to measure the property, or
different forms of it; and the roman numerals after the decimal point indicate the type of method, manual or automated. Thus,
5 indicates Phosphorus
5F indicates Total phosphorus
5F2 indicates Total phosphorus by fusion with {NaOH}
5F2.1 indicates Total phosphorus by fusion with {NaOH}, manual method.

The use of milliequivalents* has been retained for cation exchange and reserve nutrient data. However, the term me.\% has been replaced by the more correct me./100 g. Similarly, some phosphorus fractions are now expressed as mg/100 g
instead of mg \%. 

Because there are now several methods by which pure water may be produced, the term 'distilled' has been deleted and for the purpose of these methods 'water' means pure water. A further change involves the deletion of reference to the purity of reagents to be used (e.g., A.R.). This has been done because it may be assumed that pure reagents are necessary for use in these methods unless otherwise stated.

In these methods, results on blanks are usually subtracted from the results on samples, after the final calculation. Where samples require extra dilution, blank solutions should be similarly diluted. This allows for the situation where the
main source of contamination is the diluent solution rather than a reagent.
