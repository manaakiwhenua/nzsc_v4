# Semiarid Soils {#sec-ord-S}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-S}

Semiarid Soils are high base status soils in which a soil water deficit prevails over most of the growing season. Wetting fronts under natural climate conditions (i.e., in the absence of irrigation) fail to penetrate deeper than the base of the solum, with consequent accumulation of pedogenic (secondary) carbonate and other soluble salts.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-S}

The order comprises brown-grey earths, associated steepland soils and intergrades between brown-grey earths and yellow-grey earths and recent soils of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*. In *Soil Taxonomy*, the order corresponds with the Aridisols including Haplargids, Paleargids, Calciargids, and Natrargids, along with Cambids, but also with suborders under a xeric moisture regime (Xerepts, Xerults, Xeralfs, Xerorthents).

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-S}

Semiarid Soils occur in the inland basins of Otago and southern Canterbury, where average annual precipitation is less than about 500 mm.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-S}

1.  *Low secondary oxides.* Secondary iron and aluminium oxide levels are very low. Phosphate retention levels are also very low (usually less than 15%).
2.  *High base status.* Base saturation values in subsoils are high and rise to 100% at the base of the solum.
3.  *Parent materials.* The soils occur in materials from non-calcareous quartzo-feldspathic schist and indurated sandstone (greywacke), and fluvial and aeolian derivatives including fan and terrace deposits, and loess, respectively.
4.  *Illitic clay mineralogy.* Mica/illite clay minerals predominate with trace primary chlorite and kaolinite. Semiarid Soils almost always have an Illitic mineralogy class unless they have a clay content of less than 10% and fall into the Mixed class.
5.  *Permeability.* Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow in soils with [argillic](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-argh) or [cutanic horizons](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-cuth), and in some other silty or fine sandy soils. Infiltration may be reduced by machine traffic or stock treading when soils are saturated by irrigation water.
6.  *Drainage.* No poorly or very poorly drained soils are included.
7.  *Available water capacity.* Available water capacity is limited in most subsoils.
8.  *Low biological activity.* In the natural state, biological activity is limited by droughtiness.
9.  *High slaking and dispersion potential.* Soil materials are strongly dispersive and will readily slake.
10. *Erosive.* The soils are susceptible to wind and water erosion.
11. *Weakly buffered.* The soils are weakly buffered because of low CEC and anion adsorption capacity. They are consequently very sensitive to management, showing rapid changes in response to fertilisation, irrigation and cultivation.
12. *Soluble salts.* Soluble salts are present in many soils and land management must consider the risk of salinisation.
13. *High sodium.* Sodium occupies a large proportion of the cation exchange complex, particularly in Semiarid Soils with [argillic horizons](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-argh).
14. *Climate.* Average annual precipitation ranges from about 350 to 500 mm, with zero water surplus and a spring soil moisture deficit.
