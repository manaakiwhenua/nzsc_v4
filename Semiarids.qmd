# Semiarid Soils {#ord-S .unnumbered}

## Concept of the Order {#con-S .unnumbered}

Semiarid Soils are high base status soils in which a soil water deficit prevails over most of the growing season. Wetting fronts in the natural state fail to penetrate deeper than the base of the solum, with consequent accumulation of pedogenic lime and soluble salts.

## Correlation {#cor-S .unnumbered}

The order comprises brown-grey earths, associated steepland soils and intergrades between brown-grey earths and yellow-grey earths and recent soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. The order corresponds with the Aridisols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {#occ-S .unnumbered}

Semiarid Soils occur in the inland basins of Otago and southern Canterbury, where precipitation is less than about 500 mm per year.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#acc-S .unnumbered}

1.  *Low secondary oxides.* Secondary iron and aluminium oxide levels are very low. P retention levels are also very low (usually less than 15%).
2.  *High base status.* Base saturation values in subsoils are high and rise to 100% at the base of the solum.
3.  *Parent materials.* The soils occur in materials from non-calcareous quartzo-feldspathic schist and indurated sandstone (greywacke).
4.  *Illitic clay mineralogy.* Mica/illite clay minerals predominate with trace primary chlorite and kaolinite. Semiarid Soils almost always have an Illitic mineralogy class unless they have a clay content of less than 10% and fall into the Mixed class.
5.  *Permeability.* Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow in soils with [argillic](#diag-argh) or [cutanic horizons](#diag-cuth), and in some other silty or fine sandy soils. Infiltration may be reduced by traffic or treading when soils are saturated by irrigation water.
6.  *Drainage.* No poorly or very poorly drained soils are included.
7.  *Available water capacity.* Available water capacity is limited in most subsoils.
8.  *Low biological activity.* In the natural state, biological activity is limited by droughtiness.
9.  *High slaking and dispersion potential.* Soil materials are strongly dispersive and will readily slake.
10. *Erosive.* The soils are susceptible to wind and fluvial erosion.
11. *Weakly buffered.* The soils are weakly buffered because of low CEC and anion adsorption capacity. They are consequently very sensitive to management, showing rapid changes in response to fertilisation, irrigation and cultivation.
12. *Soluble salts.* Soluble salts are present in many soils and land management must consider the risk of salinisation.
13. *High sodium.* Many soils, particularly those with [argillic horizons](#diag-argh) have high percentage sodium saturation of the exchange complex.
14. *Climate.* Precipitation ranges from about 350 to 500 mm per year, with zero water surplus and a spring soil moisture deficit.
