# Oxidic Soils {#sec-ord-X}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-X}

Oxidic Soils contain low-activity phyllosilicate clays and secondary oxides (especially iron together with subordinate aluminium oxide clays) which give rise to variable charge properties and common reddish colours. They form in the clayey weathering products of mafic rocks. The soils have a fine or very fine polyhedral structure with friable failure to stable microaggregates of 2 mm or less, and low plasticity in relation to clay content. Surface horizons are clayey, and an increase in clay content occurs with depth although clay illuvial features are generally not apparent. Coarse materials in Oxidic Soils may comprise nodules (see [nodular horizon](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-nodh)), or rock fragments that are frequently coated with secondary oxides.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-X}

The order comprises most of the strongly weathered red loams and brown loams, many northern brown granular clays, and a few brown granular soils from weathered tephra beds and basaltic and andesitic rocks of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*. It correlates with the Oxisols of *Soil Taxonomy*.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-X}

Oxidic Soils are only known to occur in the Auckland and Northland regions. In Northland they can be associated with boulder  fields of mafic volcanic rock.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-X}

1.  *Low-activity clay.* CEC is low at field pH. ECEC is less than 12 cmol~c~/kg (clay), and CEC less than 16 cmol/kg (clay). The soils are weakly buffered. Some subhorizons have a net positive charge. Oxidic Soils usually have the following mineralogy classes: Kandic, Ferritic or Aluminitic/Gibbsitic.
2.  *High phosphate retention.* P-retention ranges from 60 to 90%. High sulfate adsorption occurs in B horizons.
3.  *Parent materials.* The soils are derived from andesites, dolerites and basalts of mid-Pleistocene age or older.
4.  *Limited rooting depth.* The extension of plant roots is limited by high dry bulk density and high penetration resistance, particularly in well drained soils. Plant root depths are shallow to medium.
5.  *Moderate or rapid infiltration.* Hydraulic conductivity of surface horizons and upper B horizons is moderate or faster, giving excellent trafficability and workability immediately after rain.
6.  *Slow permeability.* Hydraulic conductivity decreases to slow or marginally slow values with depth, such that perching of water occurs within the root zone after high intensity rainfalls. The duration of wetness varies from 1 to 2 days in well drained soils to 4 days or more in poorly drained soils.
7.  *Soil water deficit.* Deficits occur in summer and are exacerbated by low readily available water capacities and shallow rooting depths.
8.  *High clay contents.* Clay content ranges from 50 to 90%.
9.  *Well-developed structure.* Topsoils have mostly well developed spheroidal or polyhedral peds. Topsoil bulk densities are low.
10. *Strongly weathered with very low nutrient reserves.* The soils have very low reserves of potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus. Despite a strongly weathered fine earth fraction, coarse rock fragments that are no more than moderately weathered may still occur.
