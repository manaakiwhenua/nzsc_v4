Welcome! 

This is a [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) version of the New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC), draft 4th edition. This version contains only minor typographical corrections at April 2022.

Introductory information about the NZSC is available at [The New Zealand Soils Portal](https://soils.landcareresearch.co.nz/topics/soil-classification/nzsc/). 

The third edition of the NZSC (Hewitt, 2010) should be treated as current, and can be downloaded from the [Manaaki Whenua Digital Library](http://doi.org/10.7931/DL1-LRSS-1-2010).

The intent of this project is to demonstrate 

  * utility of the Bookdown authoring format for interacting with the classification on electronic devices
  * utility of Git for tracking changes to the classification over time.
