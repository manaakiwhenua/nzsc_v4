# Podzols {-#ord-Z}

## Concept of the Order {-#con-Z}

Podzols are acid soils with low base saturation. Podzols have an horizon of accumulation of aluminium occurring as complexes with organic matter and/or as short-range-order minerals (typically with silicon as allophane/ imogolite). Iron (typically as ferrihydrite) may or may not be accumulated with aluminium. This horizon is usually associated with an overlying E horizon indicating translocation. The E horizon may be missing as a result of erosion, ploughing or bioturbation or it may be masked by organic matter.

## Correlation {-#cor-Z}

Podzols correspond to the podzols and some podzolised yellow-brown earths of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. They mostly correspond with the Spodosols of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence {-#occ-Z}

Podzols occur in areas of high precipitation and are usually associated with forest species which produce an acid litter. They are most common in Northland, North Island high country and the West Coast and high country of the South Island.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {-#acc-Z}

1.  _Secondary oxides strongly differentiated between horizons._ In A and E horizons, sand and silt grains are uncoated. In B horizons they are coated, and in some soils cemented, by short-range-order minerals and/or organic matter.
2.  _Low base saturation._ Base saturations are very low and the soils are extremely acid in A and E horizons. KCl-extractable-aluminium levels are high, and aluminium in soil solution may be toxic to some plants.
3.  _Parent materials._ The soils occur mainly in materials from silica-rich rocks such as granite, greywacke, schist or rhyolite.
4.  _Mineralogically differentiated._ Mica-smectite or smectite often occur in A and E horizons, and hydroxy-coated or interlayered minerals or allophane often occur in the B horizon. In some Northland soils, silica is dominant in B horizons. Podzols cover a wide range of mineralogy classes.
5.  _Limited rooting depth._ The rooting depth is limited for many introduced plants by low pH or aluminium toxicity, or by pans which often cause problems of wetness.
6.  _Low biological activity._ Low levels of faunal activity occur with a low rate of mineralisation. Carbon/nitrogen ratios are very high. The accumulation of weakly decomposed humus and minimal incorporation of humus into the upper mineral soil results in a mor-like humus form.
7.  _Mor-forming vegetation._ The soils have been associated with vegetation producing an acid litter of low nutrient content.
8.  _Infertile._ The soils have very low natural fertility with high nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime requirements.
9.  _Wet climate._ The soils occur mainly in areas with a precipitation of 1400\ mm or more and unless sandy, are likely to have a soil water surplus for a considerable part of the year.
