# Gley Soils {#sec-ord-G}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-G}

Gley Soils are poorly-drained and very poorly-drained soils. In their undrained state, saturation occurs during prolonged periods, oxygen is limited and reducing conditions occur (typically affecting manganese, iron, nitrates, and sometimes sulfates). [Low-chroma colours](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-lch) are dominant throughout the solum or to a depth of 90 cm or more.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-G}

The order comprises gley soils and gleyed recent soils of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*. The soils correlate predominantly with soils exhibiting aquic conditions in *Soil Taxonomy*, particularly the suborders Aquents, Aquepts, Aquults, and Aquox.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-G}

Gley Soils occur throughout New Zealand, usually in low parts of the landscape where there are high groundwater-tables, or in places where there are seepages. Large areas of Gley Soils have been artificially drained to form productive agricultural land.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-G}

1.  *Segregation of iron and manganese oxides.* Particles in reduced parts of the soil are not coated by secondary oxides. [Redox segregations](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-rsegs) of iron and manganese oxides, however, are usually present elsewhere in the soil and may occupy large volumes.
2.  *Commonly formed in alluvial or colluvial parent materials.* Soils most frequently occur in relatively low parts of the landscape (e.g., hollows, footslopes, floodplains).
3.  *Wide range of clay minerals.* The clay mineralogy commonly reflects the mineralogy of the non-gleyed material from which the soils are derived. Gley Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes with Mixed, Illitic, and Smectitic being the most common.
4.  *Poorly or very poorly drained.* Topsoils have relatively high levels of organic matter and some are peaty. Subsurface horizons to depth are reduced and dominantly grey or bluish grey in colour (i.e., [low-chroma colours](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-lch)) with strong brown to dark brown or reddish [redox segregations](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-rsegs).
5.  *High groundwater-tables.* Most are affected by high groundwater-tables, at least throughout winter months. Soils with [slowly permeable layers](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-slowp) may also be subject to perching.
6.  *Shallow potential rooting depth.* Potential rooting depth is limited by poor aeration. Even after drainage, root extension may be limited in some horizons.
7.  *Relatively high bulk densities.* Bulk densities are likely to be higher than in well drained soils in similar soil materials.
8.  *Limited trafficability.* Trafficability is limited in most soils when wet and pugging damage by stock is likely.
9.  *Response to drainage.* Crops, not adapted to wetness, respond well to drainage.
10. *Minimal erosion.* Flooding or ponding of water is likely on low-lying sites, especially on floodplains. Deposition of fresh sediment is possible in these sites.
11. *Nitrogen requirement.* Nitrogen requirements are likely to be higher than for associated well drained soils.
