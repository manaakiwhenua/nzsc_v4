# Gley Soils

## Concept of the Order

Gley Soils are poorly-drained and very poorly-drained soils. In their undrained state, saturation occurs during prolonged periods, oxygen is limited and reducing conditions occur (typically affecting iron, manganese, nitrates, and sometimes sulphates). Greyish colours are dominant throughout the solum or to a depth of 90 cm or more.

## Correlation

The order comprises gley soils and gleyed recent soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification. The soils correlate predominantly with the Aquents, Aquepts and Aquox (Oxidic Gley Soils) of Soil Taxonomy.

## Occurrence

Gley Soils occur throughout New Zealand, usually in low parts of the landscape where there are high groundwater-tables, or in places where there are seepages. Large areas of Gley Soils have been artificially drained to form productive agricultural land.

## Accessory Properties of the Order

  1.  _Segregation of iron and manganese oxides._ Particles in reduced parts of the soil are not coated by secondary oxides. Redox segregations of iron and manganese oxides, however, are usually present elsewhere in the soil and may occupy large volumes.
  2.  _Commonly formed in alluvial or colluvial parent materials._ Soils most frequently occur in relatively low parts of the landscape, in hollows or associated with flushes.
  3.  _Wide range of clay minerals.__ The clay mineralogy commonly reflects the mineralogy of the ungleyed material from which the soils are derived. Gley Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes with Mixed, Illitic, and Smectitic being the most common.
  4.  _Poorly or very poorly drained._ Topsoils have relatively high levels of organic matter and some are peaty. Subsurface horizons to depth are dominantly grey or bluish grey in colour with strong brown to dark brown redox segregations.
  5.  _High groundwater-tables._ Most are affected by high groundwater-tables, at least   throughout winter months. Soils with slowly permeable layers may also be subject to   perching.
  6.  _Shallow potential rooting depth._ Potential rooting depth is limited by poor aeration. Even after drainage, root extension may be limited in some horizons.
  7.  _Relatively high bulk densities._ Bulk densities are likely to be higher than in well drained soils in similar soil materials.
  8.  _Limited trafficability._ Trafficability is limited in most soils when wet and pugging damage by stock is likely.
  9.  _Response to drainage._ Crops, not adapted to wetness, respond well to drainage.
  10.  _Minimal erosion._ Flooding or ponding of water is likely on low-lying sites, especially  on floodplains. Deposition of fresh sediment is possible in these sites.
  11.  _Nitrogen requirement._ Nitrogen requirements are likely to be higher than for associated well drained soils.
