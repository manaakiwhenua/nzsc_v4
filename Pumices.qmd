# Pumice Soils {#sec-ord-M}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-M}

::: min
Pumice soils are soils that have properties dominated by pumiceous and glassy rock fragments, and have a low clay content (which typically contains [allophanic material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-alloph)). They occur in sandy or pumiceous tephra ranging from 700 to 3500 years in age.
:::

## Correlation {#sec-cor-M}

Pumice Soils include the yellow-brown pumice soils of the NZ Genetic Soil Classification, and a few yellow-brown loams with high glass content and moderate P retention. [They correlate mainly with the Vitrands Suborder, or the Great Groups of Vitricryands or Vitraquands of Soil Taxonomy.]{.min}

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-M}

Pumice Soils occur in sandy or pumiceous volcanic ashes which are relatively young. They are distributed in the central North Island, particularly in the Volcanic Plateau.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-M}

1.  *Short-range-order clay minerals.* Clay contents are low, generally less than 10%. The clay minerals are dominantly allophane and imogolite and occur as coatings around glass or pumice particles. Phosphate retention is moderate or high. Most Pumice Soils belong to the Glassy or Amorphic mineralogy classes.
2.  *Low soil strengths.* Soil strength is weak or very weak. The soils are apedal earthy or single-grain or extremely fine spheroidal, except in welded layers which are massive and may have higher strength.
3.  *Pumice is not strongly altered.* The alteration status of pumice [rock fragments]{.min} ranges from fresh to moderately weathered. Glass is predominant in sand fractions.
4.  *Deep rooting.* The soils provide a deep rooting medium except in welded [ignimbrite.]{.min}
5.  *Very high macroporosity.* The macroporosity enables rapid drainage at low soil-water tensions. The available water [capacity]{.min} is high.
6.  *Sensitive.* The soils are non-plastic and are sensitive, with low strength when disturbed.
7.  *Resistant to pugging.* Water contents at field capacity are less than the plastic limit. Pumice Soils may, however, be susceptible to compaction on loading, with consequent reduced infiltration.
8.  *Low reserves of major nutrient elements.* Sulphur, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium are usually required for agricultural or horticultural crops. Reserve potassium is low and exchangeable magnesium is very low, particularly in subsoils.
9.  *Trace elements are likely to be deficient.* Trace elements that are possibly deficient include cobalt, copper, molybdenum, boron, iodine and selenium.
10. *Erosive.* The potential for erosion by water is high.

## Key to Groups of Pumice Soils {#sec-grp-M}

#### **MP** {#sec-key-MP}

Pumice Soils that have *both*

1.  a [gley profile form](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-gleypf), *and*
2.  [perch-gley features](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-pgley).

## Key to Subgroups of Pumice Soils {#sec-sub-M}

### **MP** - PERCH-GLEY PUMICE SOILS {#sec-MP}

Perch-gley Pumice Soils occur in periodically saturated sites (unless artificially drained) in which wetness is indicated by grey colours along with brownish or reddish mottles. The wetness is caused by perching of water on a slowly permeable subsurface layer, although a groundwater-table may also be present.

#### **MPU** {#sec-key-MPU}
