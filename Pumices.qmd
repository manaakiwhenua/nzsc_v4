# Pumice Soils {#sec-ord-M}

## Concept of the Order {#sec-con-M}

Pumice Soils are soils that have properties dominated by rhyolitic pumiceous and other glassy material along with crystals and rock fragments. They have a low clay content, typically including allophane. They occur in sandy to gravelly rhyolitic pumiceous tephra deposits ranging from 700 to 7600 years in age, and fluvially reworked derivatives. Some Pumice Soils are brittle and compact, however, despite their pyroclastic origin.

## Correlation {#sec-cor-M}

Pumice Soils include the yellow-brown pumice soils of the *New Zealand Genetic Soil Classification*, and a few yellow-brown loams with high glass content and moderate phosphate retention. They correlate mainly with the Vitrands Suborder, or the Great Groups of Vitricryands, Vitraquands or Udivitrands of *Soil Taxonomy*.

## Occurrence {#sec-occ-M}

Pumice Soils occur largely in sandy and fine to coarse gravelly (ash and lapilli) rhyolitic pumiceous tephras which are relatively young, namely Kaharoa tephra (\~700 yrs old) and the more extensive Taupō tephra (\~1800 years old) [@lowe2021]. Much less extensive Pumice Soils are formed on Waimihia tephra (\~3500 years old) south-east of Taupō and on Tuhua Tephra (\~7600 years old) near Whangamata. On steeper slopes older undifferentiated pumice deposits can be exhumed or redeposited to form Pumice Soils. Formed by retardant upbuilding pedogenesis, the great majority of Pumice Soils are distributed in the central North Island, particularly in the central Volcanic Plateau and Bay of Plenty, and on terraces alongside rivers (including Waikato and Whanganui rivers) in fluvially reworked pumiceous tephra deposits.

## Accessory Properties of the Order {#sec-acc-M}

1.  *Nanocrystalline clay minerals.* Clay contents are low, generally less than 10%. The clay minerals are dominantly allophane and imogolite and occur as coatings around glass or pumice particles. Phosphate retention is moderate or high. Most Pumice Soils belong to the Glassy or Amorphic mineralogy classes.
2.  *Low soil strength.* Soil strength is weak or very weak. The soils have earthy structre, or are apedal single-grain, except where subsoil comprise compact or weakly cemented (non-welded) layers which are apedal massive and may have higher strength.
3.  *Pumice is not strongly altered.* The alteration status of coarse pumice rock fragments ranges from fresh to moderately weathered. Volcanic glass is predominant in sand fractions.
4.  *Deep rooting.* The soils provide a deep rooting medium except in welded ignimbrite.
5.  *Very high macroporosity.* The macroporosity enables rapid drainage at low soil-water tensions. The available water capacity is high.
6.  *Sensitive.* The soils are non-plastic and are sensitive, with low strength when disturbed.
7.  *Resistant to pugging.* Water contents at field capacity are less than the plastic limit. Pumice Soils may, however, be susceptible to compaction on loading, with consequent reduced infiltration.
8.  *Low reserves of major nutrient elements.* Sulfur, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium are usually required for agricultural or horticultural crops. Reserve potassium is low and exchangeable magnesium is very low, particularly in subsoils.
9.  *Trace elements are likely to be deficient.* Trace elements that are possibly deficient include cobalt, copper, molybdenum, boron, iodine and selenium.
10. *Erosive.* The potential for erosion by water is high.
11. *Multilayered.* Profiles with lithological discontinuities and buried soil horizons or paleosols are common where the diagnostic pumiceous mantle becomes sufficiently shallow so that underlying tephra (or other) layers and associated soil horizons occur within the pedon being classified.

Perch-gley Pumice Soils occur in periodically saturated sites (unless artificially drained) in which wetness is indicated by [low-chroma colours](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-lch) along with brownish or reddish mottles. The wetness is caused by perching of water on a [slowly permeable layer](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-slowp), although a groundwater-table may also be present.
